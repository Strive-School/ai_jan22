0,1,mens ultrasheer,"This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
1,4,Surprisingly delightful,"This is a fast read filled with unexpected humour and profound insights into the art of politics and policy. In brief, it is sly, wry, and wise."
2,2,"Works, but not as advertised","I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
3,2,Oh dear,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
4,2,Incorrect disc!,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
5,2,Incorrect Disc,"I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it."
6,2,DVD menu select problems,"I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play."
7,3,My 2 y/o grandson loves it!!,"This movie with all of its animals really keeps my grandson occupied when I'm babysitting. He loves watching it over and over again. I can get so much accomplished before he gets bored with it. So, it is worth the money! As a matter of fact, I'm buying one for his house, his 3 y/o cousins' and my house. We're saying goodbye to Netflix! Way to go Amazon!!Gammy"
8,5,A Cookbook Every Baker Should Own,"I found a copy of this cookbook at a local used book store and mixed up a sourdough starter the following day. It was bubbling away the next morning and I can't wait to try it in a few more days...The directions in this book are simple to follow. The anecdotes and history provided are entertaining. The recipes all sound delicious! I'll be working my way through many of these, starting of course with the sourdough hotcakes and bread. The handwritten format just adds to the charm of the book. If you're interested in learning to make sourdoughs, this book will give you all the information you'll need."
9,3,good basic,"The book is a basic ""how to"" book for using sourdough. The author obviously has lots of experience cooking with a sourdough starter.I would have loved more recipes, but I did go search for my more on the internet."
10,3,nice screen for a nice price but....,"I compared a few different flat panels with review before I narrowed down my pick, which ended up with the Sylvania as over well liked. The picture got great reviews which yes it does have a good picture to look at but there are other important qualities you enjoy that makes viewing tv all the better. For example: sound... how was that forgotten?In this flat panel, it was. What a disappointment. If this is consider stereo than why does it sound like its coming from a tin can with no base at all. Then too boot, if you play the dvd, the sound drops and you have to really turn up the volume to hear.I want the whole package deal: space saving, great picture, and good sound. I want to enjoy the whole experience of watching and listening. How about you?"
11,3,"Poor maps, no hostels","It's a good book, but the maps are not very good, covering only parts of central areas and there aren't subway maps. Moreover there isn't anything about hostels!"
12,2,Profound then. Truly horrible now.,"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
13,1,A complete Bust,"This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions."
14,5,Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure,"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
15,5,Best Game for Young Girls,"My daughter absolutely loves this game! It's easy to use and requires no adult supervision. Best of all, it allows girls to use their creativity to design their own castle one room at a time. What more could a girl want! My daughter wants to play it every day and I have to find excuses to keep her away! Too bad not all the Barbie games are this easy and fun. I've been very disappointed in others I purchased. I discovered that they're not all designed/published by the same company. I paid 5.99 for this game on clearance and it's been worth 10 times this amount!"
16,2,Not so good - ok for a rental!,"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
17,1,NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC,"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
18,4,"Good Program, Lots of Flexibility",My 4year old really likes this game. She's not addicted to it but loves the style of the program and it is one of her favourite games. I recommend this program for 4-7 year olds. Anybody older may find it limited.
19,3,A Blast From My Past,"I once purchased a 12"" of Jesse Rae's song RUSHA. I really enjoyed it and thought it might be nice to have an overview of his work. It's funny how you can remember somthing fondly only to hear it later in life and think...it's okay. Sorry, but the same is true for this recording, a bit dated, a bit tiresome, but fun."
20,1,Very disappointed!,This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
21,5,Filled from cover to cover with practical guidance,"Written by Elizabeth Crary (a parent educator of 25 years' experience), Dealing With Disappointment: Helping Kids Cope When Things Don't Go Their Way offers parents, teachers, child care providers, and anyone else who works with children a straightforward guidance to teaching children how to meet and deal with seemingly insurmountable challenges. From learning to recognize when children are truly upset or shaken; to the dangers of trying to make or keep children happy at all times; to teaching young ones self-calming and problem-solving skills with step-by-step guides and games; to learning how to keep one's cool when the kids lose theirs, Dealing With Disappointment is an excellent and strongly recommended resource filled from cover to cover with positive and practical guidance and guidelines."
22,5,Hardest Pit in the South,"Big Pokey is one of the best rappers out of the South. No one can do it like him. This album is a small example of what he can do on the mic. Need more proof, listen to the old Screw tapes. You must have this cd in your collection and be on the look out for that new Big Pokey coming soon!!!"
23,5,Amazin,"This is an amazing blend of hot beats and a good rapper. It's underground, so many of you might be nervous about buying it. But, I'll tell you, Pokey sounds a lot like Biggie Smalls (BIG). He has biggie's style, usin words like sho nuff. Pokey's lyrics are good, but a few lyrics could use a little work. A few of his songs have complex beats, but most have a little bit of a more simple beat. The album comes together great. Get it! Trust me...its worth the money"
24,1,Caution!,"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
25,2,Not the best in the series,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
26,2,Too Uncomfortable and Too Big,"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
27,5,DOPE SEZ ME,"THIS IS SIMPLY A GREAT ALBUM, FULLA CLASSIC BEATS AND SUPER FUTURISTIC INTELLIGENT BASS. ON OF MY FAVORITES."
28,4,Very authentic,"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
29,4,good,works real good....a little hard to set up...web part doesnt work thru handset manager as advertised.....have to go into networking and turn it on
30,3,Too Big,It is a quality ball but the small is still too big and heavy for my little yorkie to play with comfortably.
31,3,A decent read,"I have to admit that this is a book I never would have thought to purchase given that it would mean reading the bio of an 18 year old kid!!! Still, it was a gift and I have to say that I was very surprised.The book is short (under 200 pgs) and is an easy read. However, I found that a lot of the book read like a magazine article, given that the author usually writes for Slam magazine, this is no surprise. Still, it is interesting and entertaining. I would recommend for fans of Lebron, high school ball, or die-hard hoops fans."
32,5,ME FASCINA LEER LA VIDA PROFESIONAL,"Y TAMBIEN LA VIDA INTIMA DE LOS TRIUNFADORES...Por eso me fascinó este libro que me regaló mi esposa !Y seguro a mis cuantes tambien..porque alguno de ellos me ""incautó "" el libro !YA DEVUELVELO, BRO!"
33,3,Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o),"Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold..."
34,5,Divinely Wonderful,In a world where media is dominant this movie is so refreshing as it chronicles the agony of a person who yearns for God. Watch it! 0:)
35,2,Never gets going,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
36,4,Good Stuff,"This book is quite touching. It tells Dorie's story of all the unbelievably horribe things she experience while growing up being abused both physially and sexually. It gives hope to those who believe that no one's situation is as bad as their's or those who think recovery is not possible. If you are looking for self help to enhance you own healing journey this book is probably not what you need if you dont fall into the above categories. However, it is a great testimony to be aware of."
37,2,Yet another unsubstantiated case....,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
38,2,Unmasked..................,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
39,4,A museum exhibit inside a book,"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
40,4,Good introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine,"As a physician who is studying and doing acupuncture, I find this a good basic introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is heavily illustrated, which helps the reader to understand some very difficult concepts, which are alien to the Western mind, especially for medical personnel. I can highly recommend it for someone who is interested in becoming familiar with Acupuncture and other Traditional Chinese Medicine."
41,5,Love it,"I bought this pillow for my mother, fiancee and myself. My mother loves it and sleeps much more comfortably with it. My fiance will not sleep with out it; according to him it gives him the best sleep he's ever gotten. I hurt my back a while back at work and this pillow has helped my back pains go away while giving me a restful night. I would definitely recommend this pillow."
42,2,Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum,"I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
43,4,The best Racket ever made,I've been using this model racket for around 15 years and it's still one of the best rackets ever made by Prince. The Prince Graphite Mid Plus is still one of the stiffest rackets you can get and it also has excellence weight and balance.This racket is more suited to the higher standard player. It provides exceptional control especially with volleys. I have these rackets strung at between 62-64 pounds for hard court and grass court play.It will be a sad day when there are no more of these rackets available.
44,2,Bad skating technique,"I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
45,3,Not for 8 year olds and up,This game interesting. It has good graphics and nice music. But if youre my age lets re-think the fun part. All you do is press up and down on the keybord and maybe you would hit the space bar. Well if your child likes challenging games well don't get this for them. THIS IS FOR A PRESCHOOLER!!!!
46,1,Waste of money!,"Like many of the Barbie CD Roms, the playtime is limited - averaging about 5 mins for each of my two daughters (ages 5 & 7). Like the Barbie movies and other CD Roms the graphics are poorly done."
47,4,A good game to buy.,"I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
48,1,Three Days of Use and It Broke,"Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
49,3,"It works, but it isn't great","These work fine and we now have two in the apartment, but i often have to take the remote off the wall and bring it closer to the switch to get the lights to turn off. It's not the greatest product and to be honest the as seen on TV handy switch works much better and is much cheaper."
50,5,One of my Favorites,"I was sceptical about this book at first, I had never read L. J. Smith before, but my friend told me to read it and let me borrow her's. It was soo good. That was about a year ago. I have now read up to Black Dawn in the Night World series, and can't wait for more. I recomended these books to my other friends and they loved them too. I recomend ANY L. J. Smith books to anyone."
51,5,You gotta read this book!,"I loved reading this book, it was so awesome. All of Lisa Jane Smith's books are. I was first drawn to this book because it involved three awesome sisters and they were all vampires. Plus I loved their older brother Ash! You have to read this book."
52,5,Great single,"I agree w/ the other fans: Chocolate is a fantastic single. If you like the song, you'll love the remixes! They give nice alternatives to an already gr8 song, and you'll get a bonus, non-album track. Highly recommended, and have a gr8 day, reader."
53,3,"It's just OK, not great",I bought the DVD thinking it would be back to back episodes of Thomas with no interruptions. Instead it has footage of a Thomas event and children and adults giving reviews of Thomas and their favorite episodes. I found it cheesy and annoying. My son loves Thomas and I hoped it would be strictly the episodes and not other footage. Thankfully the footage between the episodes is brief enough to tolerate the video.
54,5,Great Lessons!,Our two-year old grandson loved this - and we enjoyed watching it with him. Some good lessons to be learned by any age!
55,4,Nice mix of Thomas episodes and real footage.,My son really liked this as it shows some scenes from Thomas' Day Out which he could relate to having been before.The footage is mixed in with Thomas episodes and interviews. The brief interview sections did'nt really hold his attention but the rest is really good.
56,5,It is a surge protector,"What can I say it is a surge protector and small enough to use with small electronic items such as a wireless phone system, isolated devices and so on that do not need a big strip."
57,2,Too Small,"I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
58,2,Cut smaller than usual,"I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
59,3,Dockers Pants from Bealls,"I ordered the individual fit Dockers pants. Although there was a tag on the pants that said they were individual fit, thy lacked the inside label I am used to seeing stating they were individual fit. The fit seems a little different from other individual fit pants I have purchased. I think next time I will go back to a local retailer."
60,5,Fun Novel for Foodies,This novel is just fun...not super serious literature but enjoyable.I would recommend this to anyone who loves Italy and food...You can read it in a day....
61,4,The title says it all...,"This is a very fun book and if you love Rome, Romans, Romance and Food and Wine, you'll be ecstatic over this read! Enjoy and Bueno Appetito..."
62,2,Not very good....,"I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
63,2,"Light reading, light in substance","A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up."
64,2,The food is sexier than the sex,"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."
65,5,"I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't...","I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD."
66,3,3 stars for production,"it really pains me to see bone thugs loose to the hot boyz for group of the year at the source awards.everybody was pi$$ed over that robbery.i have a lot of respect for southern rap music.but bone had a far superior album then this album.after that i lost all hope in the source awards.this album have a somewhat solid production value from mannie,but honestly the lyrics are kinda boring.and honestly is no where near as raw as older no-limit albums,and definatley far away from tripple 6 mafia albums."
67,3,I've heard better.,"Although better than there latest album I didn't care much for Guerilla Warfare. I found alot of the songs on the album to all sound almost exactly the same. It did have some outstanding hot tracks like I need a Hot Girl, Respect my Mind, and Tuesdays and Thursdays but most of the CD was just a bunch of decent tracks nothing that big. If you want to listen to good album by Cash Money get the Big Tymer$ Hood Rich album. That one is much better."
68,3,Disappointing,Before i say anything about this album Cash Money Records is the Sh*t. I just didn't think this album was very good. The beats and hooks were not what i was expecting. I need a Hot Girl was the best song.
69,4,HTML The Complete Reference,"This is a book that I read at home, in chunks of 30-45 minutes a night. I highly recommend this book, as both an introduction to HTML, and as a reference for beginner-to-intermediate programmers. It covers HTML in depth, but also mentions CGI, Cold Fusion, ASP, Javascript, and XML, and the role these technologies play in delivering a complete website. The book contains extensive information about Style Sheets, including an entire appendix devoted to the syntax and parameters for Style Sheets."
70,4,I bought this book after reading these reviews...,"and I have been quite satisfied.Although I don't think a ""Complete"" reference book on programming, especially HTML, can exist, this is as complete and updated as it gets.Being a professional and advanced programmer I might be tempted to claim this as the best book there is, but for beginners I suggest they start with a book which is more of a ""tutorial"" than a ""reference"". A smaller book that puts more emphasis on ""teaching"" the basic concepts than providing an extensive reference resource. But after that I strongly suggest they get this book.Remember, no single programming book can ever be a good reference while being a good tutorial. And we need both."
71,3,CHECK IT OUT BEFORE YOU BUY IT,"Being a great fan of ff6,I was impatient to listen to this record.At first I thought it was impressive with the orchestra.But then the more I listened to it the more I felt a bit disapointed.I think that some songs dont grasp the original feeling of the game and that some of them dont even respect the original tunes.But you mustnt get me wrong,it still stays a wonderful record,even though it is not totally faithful to the game. Anyway the best advice I can give is to LISTEN TO SOME SONGS BEFORE BUYING IT,to avoid any disapointment."
72,4,Helpful for sore throat and cough,I have been using this product for years because I have a chronic cough. I think it helps keep my throat moist and helps prevent and alleviate sore throat.
73,4,"Every time I play it, my friends want a copy. A coming star.",A great guitarist with lots of feeling for his work. Can't wait for his next record!
74,4,Amazing...,love it...very touch.it's to bad that in the dvd description doesn't mention no subtitles
75,2,More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!,"the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!"
76,4,Very good romantic read,"This is a very good background book for the Dark Series by Christine Feehan. Very romantic, sometimes a little slow, but still worth reading!!"
77,5,The Scarletti Curse,"This is another of Christine Feehan brilliant books. She can make you part of that, that is written. You start reading and you can't put it down, I know I couldn't. If you enjoy books of physical,telpathic and romance you will love this. Every time I read one of her books they just get better."
78,4,Best Camcorder you can buy for under ...,"This is truly an excellent camcorder for home movies and perhaps more advanced applications. I found myself toying around with the nightvision contantly. My only qualms about it was that recording videos to your PC is really dependent on how good a computer you have. For instance, my computer, which is fairly fast would typically have very smooth recording, but every once in a while would skip a few frames, and I would then have to go back and edit it. But don't get me wrong, I truly believe that this really is the best camcorder you can buy for this kind of money, and besides the computer transfer issure, I absolutely love the camera."
79,4,Fingerprints,"Cornwell takes hold of your mind and does to let go until Scarpetta finds her solution. There is a horrible crime scene but it does produce some fingerprints. This is an easy case for Scarpetta until there is a match. It was a match to murderer that was executed before this murder. Read the book it is a good one. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
80,4,Review,"This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
81,2,Just Plain Cruel Will Do,"I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
82,5,what happend to Mark?,I just wrote a review on this book and I forgot to include something. WHAT HAPPEND TO MARK. Out of the blue he's all of a sudden dead!
83,4,Scarpetta has everything you want,One of the best but all Scarpetta are terrific. Love how she continues the characters and creates wonderful story lines in each book. Scarpetta is a must read for crime mystery fans!
84,4,Spellbound!,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
85,2,"Too scattered, too shallow","Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
86,4,Apatow's most mature effort...,"... and perhaps that's what made it unpalatable to many of his fans. Characters are extremely well-developed (AND portrayed), there is more heart underneath the expected ""potty humor..."" if Mr. Apatow continues to grow as a writer, I'll continue to watch his movies."
87,3,"""Funny People"" has a poignant strong beginning and then turns into something completely different in the second act","Length:: 6:20 MinsFunny People is really two movies -- One about Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen....and the other about trying to get back Leslie Mann and a whole bunch of extra drama. The story between the two guys is great, the other story takes away from the first.[...]"
88,2,"Obviously, not Adam Sandler's best","An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
89,1,profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!!,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
90,1,Depressing then becomes boring,my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
91,3,Grafic Novels,Our book club tried the Rabbi's Cat to see what all the press concerning new grafic novels. I found it interesting but still prefer when reading a novel to have my own ideas of the people and surroundings. Guess that why after reading a novel I am not impressed with going to a movie with hollywood interruptations.
92,1,Uneducated Nonsense,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
93,3,"Utter, yet amusing nonsense","John Malatich: the man, the philosophy, the legend. Perhaps only two of the three will suffice to describe this author his magnum opus: ""The Theory of Everything is..."". Unintentionally bizaare, Mr. Malatich expresses his philosophy in swarms of capital letters and misplaced parentheses that invite the reader to vainly delve deeper into the text to find the hidden meanings that are simply not there. Unlike the Codex Sepentarius or the Voynich Manuscript, this work does not use its own script; however, like those two, the inscrutbility of text and alien drawings lend an otherworldly note to the text.Though I'm giving this book a 3/5, do not think that I'm endorsing Mr. Malatich's ideas, as I find them puerile and easily refutable by even the untrained eye. However, taken as a sort of 'art' , this book stands as a brazen testament to the American kook: those who willingly and unabashedly ignore reality in preference to living within its confines."
94,1,Impossible to read,This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Amazon really needs to take more time in converting these. In this condition this should be free.
95,2,Still haven't received item,"Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
96,1,My brain froze over,"This supposed ""thriller"" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through."
97,4,Do we Finally See the End of Temple Gault?,"I read a lot of the reveiws, and I don't agree with quite a few of them. I thought this book was pretty good, and exciting. Yes, the plot is a little thinner than previous books, and yes Kay does wear on one after a time, but the forensics are awesome, and the suspense keeps on and on. I do have to admit that I do tire of Lucy somewhat. To me the books would be better without that added character. In this book Kay, Marino and Wesley are on the trail of the infamous Temple Gault (Kay's long time nemesis). The story is set around the week from Christmas Eve to New Year's Eve, but a lot happens in that short time. We see Kay, Marino and Wesley panicking as they try to nail down what seems to be the most notorious serial killer in the country at that time. Pretty good stuff!"
98,5,Wonderful!,"This book by Patricia D. Cornwell holds the suspense and mystery as her other six Scarpetta novels, including the new one. It is wonderful because it offers what the reader is looking for if he/she has read other Cornwell novels. If that's what you like, this is what you're looking for"
99,2,Very Dissapointing,"From Potters Field is one Patricia Cornwell's worst book she has written. It's not the characters, nope. It's not the writing that is wrong. It's the story that makes the book disappointing.Temple Gault has struck again. This time we know this for sure. Both the readers and Kay Scarpetta do. Someone from Lucy's past is also back. The problem with this book is that Gault is not a strong enough villain to carry this book. He is not scary or very threatening. It's not exiting. Partly because we never get into his head we are always inside Scarpetta's. Even if Cornwell did venture inside his head I'm not sure if it would be that exiting. For a killer on the loose plot its very weak, of coarse the forensics are very good and original. But for the most part a very disappointing Scarpetta novel."
100,3,"adulterous,amoral,atheistic feminist saves the day","Although I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's style andwould have loved to read another of her books,I cannot stand the ""better-than-thou"",militaristic,amoral, atheistic, adulterous lascivious feminismthat is being promoted in this book. My motherand sister are feminists and they go to churchevery week, care for their children and husbands,remain unconditionally faithful to their spouses,carry themselves gently, are very loving and, mostimportantly, desire equal rights with and notsuperiority over men."
101,3,Disappointing - Not Up to Other Books in This Series,"Let me preface this review by saying I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Scarpetta series. This book, however, is not up to the other books in this series and I was disappointed.This mystery features the same cast of characters as the other Scarpetta mysteries. However, the crazy sadist, Gault, appears to be a caricature of a person. There's one formulaic clue after another and it becomes unbelievable. The protagonist, Kay Scarpetta, is shop-worn and new characters are introduced but never developed. Marino, the politically incorrect, chain-smoking cop is the most real and endearing character in the book.Supposedly a mystery, this book drops clues from the sky, more in line with a fantasy."
102,2,You sure can tell this was written by an accountant...,"There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
103,5,Haizlitt takes a shot across the bow of bogus mathematic economics,"In the tradition of Bastiat's - The Law, Haizlitt slays his philosophical opponents with clear, biting truth; and, packs it all into 100-odd pages. Especially appropriate given the time period in which it was penned, Haizlitt effectively puts to rest Keynesian notions of mathematical precision and makes the best case for economic freedom produced in the 20th century. Highly readable...a ""Human Action"" for the masses."
104,3,Good book.. but a little misleading.,"This book is most definitely an interesting read; however, I bought it with the purpose of helping me in a Microeconomics class. This book isn't about teaching you basic economics. It's more of an opinion piece. So buyer beware - if you're looking for an educational, informational, technical book about economics, this one won't fit the bill."
105,2,NO Help,This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none.
106,2,Too simplistic,"Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
107,1,No lessons learned,"This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
108,4,Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication,"I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
109,4,TMNT Soundtrack,I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
110,2,not quite what I was expecting,"I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."
111,2,Nineteen folktales of South and Central America,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
112,4,Good choice for getting a vintage look,"I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
113,4,Not for people with short torsos,"I am 5'6"", but I have a long torso. That resulted in a 2"" section of skin/fat that was squeezed out of the bottom of this thing. I ordered their vest to see if it would be a better fit for me. 4-stars though, because it did actually work, and appeared to have sturdy construction. It was a bit constricting at first, and it definitely felt good to take it off at the end of the night and breathe deeply--but it helped me look much better in a tight-fitting cocktail dress than I looked alone or with spanx!"
114,3,Sizing is inconsistent,"I ordered two different styles of the Squeem but the sizing is inconsistent. You may wear one size in one product and a total different size in the other even though it is fitting the same body part. Strange. Also, the edges of the product rubs against my skin and leaves bruises. I look like I got in a fight with a Tiger and lost."
115,4,Works,"I was very skeptical about this. When I do wear it,it does work. It takes some getting used to."
116,4,Magic,"After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
117,4,Does it what it claims!,Took off a few inches of my waist and kept it there! A bit tough to get used to so I recommend using a tank top under the squeem.
118,3,My Squeem,"I've been wearing my squeem off/on for about 2-3 weeks. I haven't noticed a change in my waist size but when I have it on, I look really good. It gives me that nice curve that I usually don't have. I've not given up hope on it yet."
119,2,Would be great but...,"The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
120,3,Okay,"I purchased this product for postpartum compression, and I only found it to be okay. The sizing puzzled me as I seemed to fit into 3 different sizes - XS for dress size, M for actual measurement, and S is right there in the middle. I ended up with the medium which fits but I think I should have purchased the small. I also purchased the belly bandit, and for postpartum compression I would much prefer that product. I do agree that the squeem makes for a good shape and it is comfortable to wear."
121,2,Burn Rubber on Me,"I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
122,2,Not worth the price...,"I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
123,2,Why does everybody rave when....,"This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
124,2,Not OK!!!,"When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
125,3,Really Helps with Muffin Top,"This product is OK. The ideal behind it is great, but in my case it needs to be longer I think. I'm not tall about 5'6"" & weight about 155. After I get it on there is a roll between the bottom of my bra and the top of the waist cincher. It would be alright if your shirt isn't very snug, but isn't that the whole purpose of the waist cincher, to be able to wear jeans, shirts & dresses that are a little close fitting. It does help with the hang over with the lower cut jeans. Its just hard to wear a tight fitting shirt with them. Other than that it works pretty good. Would like to try the squeem vest to eliminate the roll between bra & waist cincher."
126,4,No more love handles!,"I like this product. I suffer from chronic love handles especially when I wear jeans. I am 5'1"" and 122 pounds. I bought a medium because I tried my friend's small and it was way too tight for me. The medium fits well. It does get a bit hot. I love the way it hides my love handles."
127,1,WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through,"The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it."
128,4,The hype is true,"I only just started wearing this today but already I know I'm going to be wearing it daily, and without discomfort. I'm 6 weeks postpartum and really needed something to help me shrink back down to my former size and I do believe this WILL do the trick.So far, the hype is true. It doesn't roll down on the edges and it really evens out the figure very nicely - even under clothes you can't tell you are wearing this. I guess a con would be that I can see how you'd get sweaty wearing this all day long and especially in hot weather.Overall, I am impressed so far."
129,4,Very sturdy,This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front.
130,5,Bad posture no more,I bought this product because it promised to help improve bad posture and it does. Even when I am not wearing it I find myself sitting more erect than I used to. I love it!
131,1,I got burned after few hours wearing it,"the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
132,2,nice product,My wife loves it but we unfortunately perchaced the wrong size. She made a coment about the sizing chart being in dress sizes and she picked the size she is and we received it and the apparel was way too small. We have been meaning to exchange it but its tough to get time being as we have new born twins. That's why she wanted the apparel. She was really excited to receive the part and was disappointed when it didn't fit.
133,3,Should have ordered a medium,"I went back and forth over whether or not I should purchase a small or a medium. My waist measured at 30"" just right there on the cusp. I ended up ordering the small and had the hardest time getting the booger on! And oh man UNCOMFORTABLE! Yes, it cinched my waist, but the areas that weren't inside the squeem bulged out grossly e.g. above the squeem, had a nice fat roll below my bra, not attractive and could not be hidden. I looked like a nightmare in clothes. I also didn't like that it didn't cinch my hips, meaning my pants didn't fit any better. It did make my waist tiny and gave me an hourglass figure, which I have never had before. In the long run it's getting returned. It just didn't give me the silhouette I wanted, and I don't think any amount of wearing it is going to do that."
134,2,Not what I expected,"This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
135,3,Sheet is not poka dots !!!,"This is a very heavy cotton, almost too thick. It is strpped blue just like the picture. I was thinking the picure was just another style and the one ordered would be poka dots since that is the title. I have a little girl so the blue stipes don't go. You are ordering the exact picture above so no dots!!"
136,3,Color much more bright orange,The picture looks like a burnt warm orange but these are Bright orange. I really don't like the color but too much trouble to return.
137,3,good product,wish the product description had included where it was made. it was made in china. it is a well made product.
138,1,Horrible,This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense.
139,4,Good puzzle,"This is a good puzzle-but you have to put the pieces in correctly or they don't fit well. I work with kids who have autism and this frustrates them sometimes. Otherwise, it is very durable and I use it a lot."
140,5,yeah!,"Rhapsody in blue is a cool song, i guess. i'm listening to the song right now for the first time. it's cool. ,e sp driml"
141,3,Better Than Most Higgins Tales,"Edge of Danger is a step above a number of recent Jack Higgins tales. The protaginist - Sean Dillon, must track down a dangerous Middle Eastern billionaire before he can reek havoc on the world. While prior to 11 September, this book is relevant to our crisis. Higgins does a nice job bringing out more dimensions of Dillon and some of the other good guys. The author bumbles a chance to knock off a key character - losing the opportunity to add some tension and passion to the survivors. Incredibly, this person takes three bullets and lives. The plot is solid and fast paced. My only problem is with the enemies. They are too cold and their motives are weak. The key assaisin could audition for the Key Stone Cops. Don't get me wrong, the Edge of Danger is a good yarn. I hope Higgins continues to improve the depth and reality of his characters. I look forward to the next edition."
142,1,"Actually, this book is not worth one star.","This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
143,1,Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins,I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either.
144,3,Only If You Really Love Higgins,"Look. I can't really disagree with the other reviews. However, I enjoyed this book. If you, as have I, read every Sean Dillon book in the series you will enjoy spending a few hours with these characters who have become so familiar after so many years. Great literature? Not a chance. A good read for fans of Jack Higgins? Definitely!!!!"
145,4,Good matt nude lipstick,It's got a nice warm scent of vanilla-like smell. Texture is creamy. Meadow Sweet is a nice nude color. Can't apply too much or else it'll look a bit dry.
146,2,needs $$ upgrade,Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software.
147,2,The Scarlett Letter,Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said.
148,3,scarlet letter,Thought I was getting a book received book on tape. a little deceiving. Rather than that the process went as expected. If it had been what we wanted would have been great.
149,2,ok...,this book was recommend 2 me from my neighbor. but i dont think that dis is dat gud of a book 2 recommend... i didnt like it 2 much but...
150,4,we all have opinioms...,"I believe that this is a fantastic book for those who have more distinguished tastes. As for others, it is a slow read with challenging vocabulary."
151,4,Great read,I always liked this book. The kindle version is kind of difficult to navigate but it does its purpose. I can still go back to my last read without any problem.
152,5,The Great American Novel,"Hawthorne wrote a masterful work of historical fiction incorporating an examination of guilt, revenge and suffering in the context of Puritan Salem. Here is a book that speaks to any age about timeless themes. The Scarlet Letter is one of those books that may have force fed to one during grade school but revisited from the perspective of adulthood it is a very fine example of great writing from a true American master."
153,4,"Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected","I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
154,3,First try at electronic book,I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
155,3,re: slow but fascinatingly enchanting...,"I did not read much of this book, however, I do remember some of it. Often when I discuss comparative literature, I tend to use the example of Charlse Dickens's ""A Tale of Two Cities"", for in Dickens's famous novel, there are about five hundred pages of mere background information. And so, we have the style of Nathaniel Hawthorne presented to us: he is, in essence, a lover of symbolism and all things literarily analyzed. I really got into the story when the first pyre scene happened... Now, note, when I said pyre I meant pillar, for pyres are something entirely different and generally greek/medieval... Anyway, as I was saying, Hawthorned loves literary symbolism and creativity. I love the way he ended the plot, but I think that the story line could have moved a little faster, thus giving ""The Scarlet Letter"" a Dickens-like quality."
156,2,The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.,"I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
157,1,"Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.","I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
158,4,An Old-Time Soap Opera,"I am not one who enjoys romance, however Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is truely an unshakable landmark in American Literature. Unlike most people, I read this novel in college (I don't know why junior high teaches this book; it's way to advanced for that intensity of reading) and depicted it as a soap opera in Puritan society. The novel inhibits sex, suspense, drama, and romance all in one pakage. I found the invidious Roger Chillingwoth to be an extremely interesting aspect about the novel's well-rounded plot. The theme of the novel is sin, and how tragically easy it could destroy a normal town denizen. I mean, all 3 main characters are virtually consumed and eventually destroyed by their own private sins. Read this book; by doing so, one will appreciate truly powerful literature that still shakes our foundation today."
159,4,ok,i liked good book from the past....great that we can look back on these great books and enjoy them .
160,4,AAAAAAAAAA,"Scarlet Letter is a kind of book that you understand it and you love it or you dont understand it and hate it. I think this deserves four stars because of the idea of the book. A stand for adultry in this book and tells the story of puritans in that time period. Hester and Pearl faces lots of insult in this community and if you want to find out whot the secret father of Pearl is READ the BOOK!!! But I would recommend to read this book after you are 14 years, because the Idea of the book is too matured."
161,2,One word: outdated,"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."
162,1,Painful,"This book has to be one of the most tedious works of literature ever written. Hawthorne is a great writer, but I don't know how this book made it into that sacred list we call ""classics"". Perhaps on the merit of his name alone?"
163,4,"A Passionately Written Book, But It Does Happen to Bore Me","The Scarlet Letter shows Nathaniel Hawthorne at his finest. The imagery is quite wonderful, but there's only so many times you can say the same thing. The images in this novel stretch out far longer than needed.I nearly couldn't make it through. I do like to see every detail given it's fullest attention but even this is too much.This book is one that is very vivid and quite pleasing to understand, but hard to read and not as easy to follow. Sometimes there's only one resourceful fact in a half a page paragraph.Recommended."
164,3,Ehh,Thie book isnt terrible I had to read it for my AP English class and so far it has been the easiest read. I would recommend it to anyone who likes books of that time frame.. The language uses a lot of thee's and thou's
165,1,Horrible reader,i couldn't listen to this book because the women reading it has such a screechy horrible voice so i can give no review of the actual book but whatever you do try to find a version with a different reader if you're into audio books
166,3,It was OK,"I've always wanted to read this and when I got the chance, I was a bit disappointed. The language was difficult for me to grasp and there were few scenes that I understood what was going on. After reading this, I don't understand why it is a classic. Although the message of the book was clear, the Shakespeareian-style writing was hard for me to understand."
167,3,Can't compete with peer works,"I finally got around to reading this classic work last year and was quite disappointed. I tend to limit my reading these days to two primary realms, classic literature and early 20th Century fiction, and this one just didn't measure up to the standard set by other famous authors of Hawthorne's day.It's a simple story about scandal and I guess I was expecting so much more. I wish I could say it was superbly-written but I think that it reflects a lack of committed effort on Hawthorne's part."
168,3,"Glad I read it, but probably wouldn't read it again","I liked this book as I was reading it. It was really interesting to see Puritan life through Hester Prynne's eyes. I think one reason that I liked it has to do with the fact that I skipped reading the first part, ""The Custom House."" I didn't read it when the teacher told the class to read it, and I wrote a paper on it and got an A.All in all, a good book, but I don't think I would've gotten through more than half of it if I hadn't been pushed into it by my English class. Looking back, though, I'm glad I read it because a lot of other works have some thing(s) in common with ""The Scarlet Letter,"" and it would be a shame to graduate with a degree in English without reading it."
169,1,Horrific forced reading,"I will never understand why they force this book on school children, I'm sure there are many other ""classic"" stories that could be included in the curriculum."
170,4,If you read this book you will be amazed,Well I read this book and it amazed me. The first time I read this book I thought it was stupid. page after page it got better. Well this book is about a girl who commits an adultery. The girl's name is Hester. So she gets an A on her dress and she goes to prison. Her husband left her like a coward. and I don't want to ruin the story so I will recomend this book to anyone who wants a good read. When I read this book i thought it was hard comepare to the books LORD OF THE FILES and THE ANIMAL FARM. so just read THE SCARLET LETTER.
171,3,For an audience,"Hawthorne has written a book deeply in psychological symbolism and wordy sentences. This book is for those with enough patience to let a deluded, complex story develop -- not a story for me, even though I have read many in the genre."
172,4,The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American,"The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American."
173,3,Good Book,"I, as a 10th grade student, had to read The Scarlet Letter for school. at first, what came to mind was ""this is going to be the most boring, hard to read book ever, as most school books are."" I started reading it and my nightmares were coming true. i didn't understand half of what Hawthorne was trying to say. this really put me down but once we started discussing the chapters that we had read, i realized what it was about and how good it actually is. Once i knew more about the story, reading became much easier. (some parts, though were just plain tedious.) the imagry that was used was amazing and the plot was excelent. i would have given more stars but some of it was just too complicated and i couldn't follow it.Bottom line: everyone should read this book because it is a classic for a reason. (it really is a good book) but you might want to get a guide to it or maybe cliffnotes so it is esier to understand."
174,1,A sin to humanity,"No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
175,2,Looooooooooooooooong.,"If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
176,2,Not What it is Made Out to be...,"It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
177,4,Good One Book Night of Entertainment,"Quick read because the book is really a short story and some of the character language can be annoying but necessary per the theme of the novel . Interesting read especially since the book was written in the late 1800s but set in our future. Not your typical ""end of the world"" novel with all the ""glitter"" and multiple story lines like Earth Abides (same genre) but for being written so long ago the author hit the nail on the head per the cascading long-term effects of a ""Scarlet"" event."
178,5,Scarlet Letter,a classic book where there is really nothing bad to say about. AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school.
179,3,I Don't See the Big Deal,"I had to read this book, which I had heard quite a bit about, for school but after reading it I had no idea why it is considered such a classic. There is no question that the language is old-fashioned and difficult, but that isn't the only problem I found with it. The whole story was rather boring. It seemed that the author tried to make a lightweight story about an affair and the child that was a product of it deeper or more important by describing how the characters felt. The book was not exactly bad, but, like many other books, it does not really deserve its status as a classic. I saw it more as a book that showed somewhat the morals and ideas of the Puritans. While it is good in that sense, I don't think that it is very important in modern times, and it certainly wasn't a fun read."
180,3,The Scarlet Letter,"This book was purchased for my daughter for a class. I remember reading it in high school and yeap, still almost as drawn out as it was back then. We both think the same thing. But, a good read nonetheless."
181,1,unfinishable,"A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
182,4,Pretty Good.,"The whole time reading The Scarlet Letter I thought that it was just extremely interesting. The characters were well-developed and at times, endearing. The way that Hawthorne is able to describe the torture that Reverend Dimmesdale undergoes is very believable. Although I am only thirteen years old and have never committed adultery, I find it easy to relate to Hester Prynne. And Pearl, my most favorite of all the characters, just adds a very interesting touch to the story. Despite the good characters, I did not like the fact that during most of the book, parts of the main plot are dismissed for chapters at a time to describe something not always commpletely relevent to the story. But, overall, I thought this book was very interesting, and would definately take the time to read it."
183,1,Does not have true plumeria scent,"I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
184,4,The best tomato flick,"This is IMHO the best of the 4 Killer Tomato flicks. We even get to see Gary Condit briefly (from the back) in the pizza parlor fight scene!Without spoiling the surprises, I'll just say that the movie features a very sexy tomato who was once a real tomato."
185,5,Best one in Tomato Trilogy,"Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
186,1,Unreadable!,"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it. Zero stars would have been more appropriate."
187,3,"OK, but you'd better know what you're doing","All of the screws need to be double-nutted to keep them from backing out due to vibration. Replacement lamps are difficult to find, my husband ended up using 12v marker lamps from an auto parts store. Eats sidewalls for breakfast on skinny-tired bikes. A piece of 3/4"" air hose slipped over the wheel makes it able to run on the rim instead.The rear light is made to mount to a fender, FYI."
188,5,NEED A LAUGH!!!!!,IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH THIS IS THE ONE. I DON'T LIKE ANIMATED MOVIES BUT THIS IS SOOOOOOO FUNNY. THE CHARACTERS AND HUMOR CAN'T MAKE YOU FEEL SAD AT ALL. A GOOD FLICK AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT THE OFFICE.
189,3,JUST CUZ IT'S A CARTOON,"Just cuz it's a cartoon, and about the holiday's, does not make it a family movie. The movie was everything I expected, no real surprises. That said I do not feel the adult content shuold be used to grade the movie. My kids will not be seeing this for some time. My copy has PG-13 PARENTS STRONGLY CAUTIONED clearly stated on the back."
190,2,Two Tedious Hours,"The early success of Adam Sandler's films gave him this mistaken impression that he was an actor and a writer. This film proves he is neither - and a grating voice-over guy to boot. I enjoyed Happy Gilmore and to a much lesser degree, Little Nicky and Big Daddy. But Sandler is a one-trick pony. We've all seen the trick, so it's just not interesting anymore. I thought this might be the one Hanukah film in a world of X-mas fare. It has nothing to do with the holiday and is definitely not for kids."
191,3,"So stupid, its funny","I went to my sisters boyfriends house, and his roomate bought a couple of DVDs and this was one of them. I saw it, it wasnt boring, but it was stupid and it was funny, I expected more from this film, but its worht watching if like comedy and Adam Sandler."
192,1,The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler,Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer.
193,4,Eight Crazy Nights,"Adam Sandler is one of our favourite actors,and this is such a funny movie for all ages why would you not want it in your collection.Some may think its a bit much for children under 5,But my children 9+ loved to see Christmas cheers and a drunken fool wake up to the real world and how not everybodys life is bliss.It was a great movie to laugh, watch and learn all in one."
194,1,Sandler Strikes Out,"8 Crazy Nights might have been a sweet film with a good message for kids, but the scatological humor, offensive language and explicit sexual references made it unsuitable for my 10-year old. The plot, on the other hand, while fine for 10-year olds was too obvious and simplistic for most of the adults in the audience. As a result, while it's probably not the worst film of the year, it is certainly in the running."
195,1,Inappropriate for young children,"In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."
196,1,Presley's Worst Film,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
197,2,NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY,"This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
198,5,Love KidKraft,"I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
199,1,Skip it - buy the full sized version,This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.
200,4,Good Product,"I am satisfied with this product. I can stick it to the fridge (it's magnetic) and have it readily available while I'm cooking. The plastic looks a little flimsy, but I think it's good value for the money."
201,2,Fuzzy around the edges,"I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:""Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain"" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?"
202,3,Good brain-based learning text,I have heard Jensen speak at workshops and wanted to follow up his presentation by reading one of the books he mentioned.
203,4,book: Brain-Based Learning,"I purchased this book to refresh my professional development. The ""latest trend"" these days in education seems to be shifting to BBL (brain-based learning), so I wanted to update myself.I flipped through it first and saw that there is a lot of diagrams, figures, the text is easy to read, and understand.I haven't read through the entire book, but so far I can tell that this will be a useful reference or resource."
204,3,Ordered but got refunded.,"They refunded the book without notifying me of this, so I was left book-less by the beginning of the term. :("
205,5,Great lunchbox for preschoolers,This is a very nice lunchbox with beautiful colors and images. It is made of durable and washable material. And one great thing about it is that it is different as it does not have any common TV character on it.
206,3,sort of plain jane?,"I fell in love with El Cielo, which was in fact my first forray into the musical world of Dredg. El Cielo is an amazing album that follows a concept of sleep paralysis. Then I found Leitmotif, which neither moved me nor gets much spins in my cd player. Then I found Catch Without arms, which nether dazzled me nor wowed me at all. There are a few good tracks, but other than that, this album follows standard rock formula. I understand that die hard fans of Dredg will eat this album up and beg for more, but what really drew me to El Cielo was the concept album aspect and the off beat musicianship, both of which are missing from Catch without arms. Though standard, Catch without arms is decent, not a must have, but decent."
207,5,This was my intro to dredg,"Right now dredg is my favorite band. I absolutely think Catch Without Arms is one of the best albums of all time, I can listen to this over and over and have been. I like this album better than El Cielo. I can 1-repeat Zebraskin all day, that song can transport you out of a funk any day!"
208,3,Survival,"While this album certainly isn't the same music Heart was known for in the 70s, it brought them back into the music spotlight and brought new fans. Some people who like to act self important wanna call this type of change ""selling out"", but look at all the other bands of the past who refused to change - most of them are nowhere and forgotten. Very few bands of that era have a sound that maintains through time. Put ""bands of the 70s"" in your search browser and see what comes up. There's maybe 5 bands on that list that continued to produce music successfully thru the 80s and 90s. And Heart is one of them. When it comes to entertainment, if you wanna survive, you gotta give the fans what they want. And that's what Heart did on this disc and a few more after this."
209,5,Total mood enhancer,"This is one of the greatest swing albums of all time. I'm not exactly sure who played what parts (someone said that the channel credits were reversed), but Ellis and Robillard both sound great. They seem to have a bottomless well of creative and melodic swing phrases that they can throw around at will. This album will put you in a good mood quick. Make sure to check out the sequel album too - it's just as good."
210,5,A Charlie Brown Christmas,"The entire Charlie Brown series are wonderful, just purchased this one for my grandson. Would recommend as gifts for friends and family."
211,5,Sweetness,It was a gift for my dad and he loved it. One of his favorite holiday movies. Which he always seems to miss each year. Now he will have it always.
212,3,Too much money for too much Peanuts,"The original Christmas special is good, but you're mostly paying for another ninety minutes of subpar stuff. Flashbeagle is an abomination. I would have paid half for a quarter of the cartoons in here.If you can get the DVD instead of the Amazon Video version cheaper, do it."
213,5,A Christmas Classic,This is a timeless Christmas classic that still brings a lump to your throat. The music from this special is wonderful as well. A classic!
214,1,D'oh,"Every year I think we get going too quickly and make an impulse buy that's foolish. This was our purchase this year. Thankfully we got a 50% credit for making the purchase (not sure what promotion it was since I didn't see it) and we got $1 toward Amazon MP3s. So our foolishness was credited, but before you buy this always remember that it airs on tv every year (in our case 3 days after we purchased it). If we had checked our TV guide we would have seen it and been able to record it for free. Buyer beware.Don't buy it."
215,3,FOSSFILL Comfort U is best,"Some reviewers here have complained that the pillow flattens too easily. Note that according to the web site sitincomfort (The Comfort Store), there are two kinds of Comfort U pillows: one is stuffed with Fusion Fiberfill, and the other is stuffed with Fossfill. The Fusion Fiberfill is what's being sold on this Amazon page. Read carefully; other Amazon sellers stock the Fossfill version.This is an important point to consider, depending on your priorities. My understanding is that the Fusion Fiberfill is supposed to feel more like a real down pillow--which means it's likely to need to be fluffed more, too. Tricky with such a big pillow.So I recomend doing a little research and checking out the Fossfill version. The Fossfill version is allegedly better at maintaining its shape, and also lets air circulate better so it's not as hot."
216,3,could be firmer,"My wife purchased this item after all the great reviews and after using another, less supportive product. She likes the overall design but after a few weeks of use, despite the lifetime guarantee of the pillow retaining its fluffiness, found that the dependent portions of the pillow at the sides lost their fluffiness. If the product had, say a firm foam core, it would probably be perfect."
217,4,Great value overall,"You'd have to be crazy to purchase a full-priced replacement adapter directly from Apple. Third-party is the way to go here, and this Macally adapter is a great value overall.Pros: Cheap as heck, long cord, does what it's supposed to do.Cons: Cord does not easily wind up. If my PowerBook G4 is totally out of juice, the Macally needs to charge it for a few minutes before the computer will power itself up again."
218,2,third one is now broken,"I've now been through three of these cords. they seem to last around a year before just dying. The first two eventually had fatal connection issues with the piece that connects to the computer, however my third one has just died and is actually not getting any power from the wall. The little indicator just fades out, and now won't come on at all. Yes it's a lot cheaper than the other cords, but I'm just not sure its better. I know lots of people have problems with the apple cords as well."
219,3,Not as shown,"It works but what I received was not as shown, the cable did not detach from the transformer brick on the thin side."
220,4,Powerbook AC Adapter,"I had to replace the Apple adapter that came with my laptop and this is a sturdy and relatively cheap alternative to buying another Apple one. Of course, it's not as aesthetically pleasing and it doesn't have the convenient green/orange indicator light, but it does it's job. I haven't had any problems with it. I recommend it highly."
221,3,Not as good as I'd hoped.,My original power adapter gave up the ghost after about two years. With a replacement costing $80 I was motivated to try this adapter. At first it appeared more durable and I only missed the lighted rim of the original a little bit. After about a year and a half the Macally adapter has started to go out (it no longer connects well where the cable from the laptop meets the transformer).At less than half the cost of the Apple product and with few other options I'm buying another. It's the best option I can find. My Powerbook is going strong into year five but it's doing so on its third adapter.
222,2,Doesn't work properly,"Bought this about a month ago as a back-up adaptor. When used on my Powerbook G4 and my wife's iBook G4, it does not charge them when in operation. It supplies power so that the units are functional when plugged in, but it will only charge the units when they are closed or turned off. I'd give this a one star, but at least it powers them when they're on, even without the charging."
223,4,Worth the Mpney!,"Searched Hi/Low for this item. Similar products were 5 X more expensive. So far, it works like a charm!Would recommend it to anyone!Grayfox442"
224,2,The adapter shown is not the one that was shipped.,"I received a different adapter so I cannot really tell you about the Macally adapter. I received an adapter from Inspire and it does not have the longer cord, the velcro strap or the led lights. But it does charge my computer and it arrived quickly."
225,1,Worst Charger Ever!,"I bought this charger thinking that it would be compatible with my late 2005 iBook G4. The description page has nothing stating that it is not for ibook G4 but only for Powerbook G4 and ibook G3. Also, after only about 3 weeks of use the charger died completely. This is by far the worst charger I have ever had. Pros: quick ship Cons: incorrect description, lack of durability"
226,2,good price... questionable quality,"I bought this because it was a cheaper alternative to Mac's (ridiculously priced)$80 charger. At first it worked pretty good, but about a week or two after i got it it seems to not be working like it should. i think there is some kind of warranty, so i should try and exchange it...but sometimes when it is plugged into my computer it will charge for one second, then stop for one second, charge for one second, stop for one second, etc. It still manages to charge the computer, but im not sure if all this on\off stuff is necessarily good for my computer..."
227,4,Good value,"At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40."
228,4,"works well, clunky form factor","Use it to power my G4 PowerBook. Functionally it has been perfect. I don't travel with it, so I don't mind its somewhat unwieldy size and shape. If I did, I'd want a smaller adapter, like the (more expensive) one made by Apple."
229,3,"seems to work, but flimsy plug","understand that this was bought for my 16 year old son. he was thrilled when it arrived, it got his computer back to working right away. of course then he did something that broke the computer so he only used it for about a week. that said, when i took the cable and tried to work on his computer, i discovered that in the short time we'd had the adapter he'd mangled the plug where it goes into the computer. not such that it didn't go back in with some effort, but that's not a good sign in my book for such a short amount of use. so my word of caution, be really careful with it, else you could have trouble down the line. too bad the cowl isn't nice & stiff like an RCA plug, that would solve the problem..."
230,3,NOT for aluminum powerbooks!,"Beware: NOT compatible with the aluminum Powerbook, even though it says so on the packaging. Will simply not work (flickering screen, charge on and off).As someone else mentioned before, this AC adapter is NOT compatible with all aluminum Powerbooks, despite what you might be led to believe on this seller's page. I'd call customer service before purchasing this item with the serial # of your laptop handy (click the top left apple, ""about this mac"", then ""more info"") and get specific confirmation that this can supply power to your computer.I'm still giving it 3 stars though, since the shipping was really fast, and customer service was very nice/knowledgeable, giving me a complete refund for my purchase (including S&H;, etc)."
231,2,You get what you pay for.,"I had the original Apple charger that came with my Powerbook G4. It lasted me about a year and a half. I opted for this Macally charger, for two reasons, 1. the price 2. the great reviews on Amazon. I have had the charger for less the 6 months and it is already non-functional. Yes it is cheaper than the Apple charger, but it really comes out to the same price, considering that an apple charger costs about $90 and lasts 1 1/2 years and the Macally costs $30 and lasts six months."
232,1,Faulty Power Cord,"I bought this plug as a substitute to replace the Apple one that blew out. Unfortunately, this plug seems to have problems. I noticed that it heats up really badly when plugged into some plug outlets and causes my laptop to heat up as well. Once, I also heard some noise coming from my iBook G4 that wasn't there before. This noise went away when I unplugged the power cord. What I'm most upset about though is that it seems to have shortened the battery life of my computer to about 50% now! I think I should have bought the Apple plug instead."
233,5,Excellent Item!,"I miss the lighted ring telling you that the charger is charging, but for 1/2 of the price of Apple's replacement, I can do without it!The LED iS BRIGHT, and cool bluish color. The cable that breaks on Apple's charger is noticeably thicker on this charger.Get this. You'll not regret it."
234,3,Drains too fast,The price was right and it allows me to continue to use my computer but it charges and drains must faster than the original.
235,4,Works in a pinch,"The construction is solid, and the device has no serious shortcomings aside from it's 50w power output which limits it's usefulness for 15"" powerbook users. I use this as my travel adapter and because of it's lower power output than the standard 65w adapter the computer does not charge if I am using it heaviliy."
236,4,Just Needs A Status Light....,"This product is a beaute....just missing one thing, a status indicator light to know when battery is charged.You'd think with the cool blue LCD light, it would have been easy to incorporate into the design.Product doesn't get hot as did original Apple..."
237,3,Generic Adapter,"It does the job.. Poor quality product, but you get what you pay for. It does what it is suppose to after fiddling with it. Connections have a lot to be desired, but again, the price is right. If you can afford it always go for the OEM equipment you'll be a lot happier. If cheap is what you need this will work for ya.."
238,5,Breif Review of the Powerbook / Ibook AC Adapter,"Initially I was going to give this power adapter 4 stars because it lacks that charge light that the Apple adapters have, but you just can't beat the price. It is an ideal and inexpensive replacement or companion adapter. You could by a few of these for the cost of just one from Apple. The only thing to take notice is that it may not charge a laptop as quickly as the standard Apple power adapter because of it's lower wattage.Pros:- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Inexpensive- Durable- Velcro cord wrapCons:- No charge status light- Lower wattage then Apple adapter- Slightly larger then the standard Apple adapter"
239,2,I was very disappointed with this book.,"This book doesn't even come close to the quality I have come to expect from Maeve Binchy. The story lines never come together. Basically, the entire book is a set of character sketches. Yes, it kept my attention and I did finish the book, but by the time I was finished, I regretted spending the time on it and fussed at my mother who told me in advance that this was not one of her favorites. (She should have been a bit more forthcoming!) I would not recommend this book; on the contrary, I would discourage someone from investing any time on this book. There are many, many better books out there, including all others by still-a-favorite Maeve Binchy."
240,5,I love Binchy's work,This was heart-rending and displayedthe same finesse at fully roundedcharacters with their issues. The priest'sdiscoveries and how he dealt with themwere particularly poignant.
241,3,A Fast Read,"This is a collection of six interlinked stories about a family preparing for the parent's silver wedding anniversary, it gives a description of some of the family and also some of the closer friends who will be attending the wedding. We have Anna the oldest daughter, she is organising the anniversary party, and worried about what can go wrong and whether her brother Brendan will show up at the party. Brendan has all but removed himself from the family as he is tired of the acting that goes on with his mother Deirdre who's always worried about what people will think. Theres also Anna and Brendan's sister Helen a very confused, accident prone and annoying character who is trying to become a nun to get away from it all. There's the parish priest who has his own secrets and other various family and friends.This is a short book which I read in a few hours. I think if you have read the Lilac Bus and liked it you will probably like this one as well."
242,4,Pretty good book - typical Maeve Binchy style,"My mom is the Maeve Binchy reader in the family. She loves all her books. When I asked her how she liked this book, she said it was pretty good and written in the typical Maeve Binchy style. Hope you enjoy it as well!"
243,4,"""Super"" fun","Rated for 3+ but my 2 and 3 yr. olds both play with this. While the kids like playing with this, I like that it can grow with them. It has basic tools for younger children: rolling pin, presser with three tips, pizza cutter, safety scissors, play-doh knife. But it also has tools/items for older ones: bead making, art molds for pictures and ""sand"".The only con is the mat. It's cheap plastic. Sounded great on the box in the store, but ends up crinkled underneath them and not protecting the floor. Stick with using and old sheet or vinyl table cloth from the $1 store."
244,5,Great Concert DVD,"This DVD more than fufilled my expectations. Great performances of some of the best tunes I know.Yes Geoff Tate was a little bit of a ham - but it worked and worked well. I don't understand what people expect. Enjoy the band, enjoy the songs, enjoy the spectacle - and relax already!"
245,2,Poor quality and construction,"This corkscrew is poorly made, consisting of low-grade stampings and flimsy plastic molded parts assembled with tinned rivets. It feels like it's going to come apart in your hand, and it requires considerable care to use it safely and effectively. It's outrageously overpriced, too. An unfortunate product offering from the company that brought us the legendary original Screwpull, perhaps the handiest corkscrew ever.I did manage to pull a cork with it, though - which is why it gets even two stars."
246,1,The Worst Ever!!!!!!!!!,"I thought this book was the worst book ever. It was so boring! Did I mention that it was the WORST BOOK EVER!!!! It was the worst book in the history of bad books. You should never read it. Take my word on that. Oh, and I didn't just choose to read it on my own. A teacher forced me to read the dumb novel. IT'S THE WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!"
247,3,great acting by Shatrughan,"This movie is about an idealistic guy(Dharmendra) and his street smart pickpocket friend(Shatrughan Sinha). Shatru was not a big star at the time and is in a supporting role but he thoroughly chews up and outshines Dharmendra. When I watched the movie, I was completely surprised by Shatru's comic talents. He rocks big-time as the wisecracking immoral thug. Watch out for the scene when Shatru goes to the employment office to seek job (after being coerced by Dharam) and his interaction with the officer there. Alas, his comic talents weren't quite explored by any other director and this guy himself started hamming in the later stages of his career. This is among Shatru's two finest performances('Mere Apne' being the other one). Watch it for Shatru. The movie is a joyride and Shatru makes it work."
248,5,Extraordinary Read,"From introduction to ending this work is one that kept me interested and coming back for more. Lundberg's writings mentally transport readers to experiences and places that quickly spring to life. The book engendered mental pictures that demanded my attention and created a storyline that melded both old and new into an experience that evoked strong memories and visions of bustling cities, ancient fortresses, and brightly colored umbrella topped tables lining village streets . I could almost feel the humidity and heat as he revealed a place and a time that has reverberated throughout history. Ulysses has never been recounted like this! And, the story with its modern approach to describing the people of Greece and the 'Greek Experience' is right on the money!"
249,1,Feels great until it melts and then explodes.,"I had another infrared massager before this one that I used for years to help with sore muscles and a nasty TMJ condition. It finally shorted out and I bought this product just a few weeks ago. I had one of the worst headaches of my entire life yesterday and was using this on my jaw when I most unfortunately fell asleep. I guess muscle relaxers and vicodin will do that to you. Anyway, when I woke up, I found that I had rolled over and the infrared massager was underneath my pillow. It completely melted and burned through my sheets and a couple inches into my mattress. I had fallen asleep a few times with my other infrared massager with no consequences so this surprised and dismayed me. This is not a safe product - it either needs to be made of sturdier material than cheap plastic or have a timer on it - I would certainly be willing to pay the extra money to not have to worry about setting fire to my house or burning myself. Sorry - can't recommend it."
250,4,Acoustique!!,"This is a GREAT CD from a GREAT fiddler!! This is the kind of album that you don't want to put down! Pierre and his band play everything from Irish, Scottish, Quebecois, to Swing (and MORE!) If you're looking for a good fiddle cd, or just want good music, GET THIS ALBUM!"
251,4,Martha Black,Martha Black's story showed her love of the Yukon. She was a pioneer in a country that required unique skills and much courage.
252,5,Be Careful What You Wish For,"I had always heard that this short story by W.W.Jacobs was one of the great classic Victorian ghost stories. I was recently reminded of it when Stephen King mentioned it in his new e-book, ""Riding the Bullet"". So, alas! - I finally got my hands on it, and it is indeed worthy of it's acclaim. A visitor brings a magickal talisman - a monkey's paw - to his hosts' home; the macabre dismembered simian apendage is charmed with the ability to grant wishes. But the visitor who leaves the object with his hosts, also leaves their premises with a strong warning of the outcome of the things wished for."
253,3,"Nice voice, but wrong repertoire","Kozena has a pretty voice with good intonation, but it is still undeveloped and sometimes breathy. I don't think she is a Mezzo-Soprano, and these choices are the wrong literature for her. Singing 19th century music in a Baroque style does not do the drama justice. I think Kozena does herself, and the world, a disservice, by not practicing and developing her higher soprano notes. Remember that Joan Sutherland once sang Mezzo-Soprano, but changed her focus to Soprano, calling her mezzo days ""a lazy soprano""."
254,4,a worthwhile read,"Sue Bender is an artist who first learned of the Amish through their remarkable quilts. Not satisfied to learn about them second hand, she was able through great perserverance to stay with two Amish families. Plain and Simple not only recounts these visits, it also chronicles Bender's own search for meaning, simplicity, and order.Bender's book was first published in 1989 and is considered a classic. It is well worth reading."
255,4,Very interesting book. Enjoyed Reading.,"This book was a great book to pick up and read while waiting for children at music lessons. I would like to go back and read it again and make some notes in the side bars. A book you could read again, and again and come out with something else learned."
256,1,Just Okay,"This book is 'just okay.' I came away from reading the book not knowing too much about the Amish. Sue prefers to keep most of the information to herself. She does, however, make sure she gets in adequate writing about all of her 'accomplishments' -- and makes apparent her desire to return to her old life of those accomplishments. (Big hairy deal!) Personally I think she's a bore....and a boor; actually I found her to be pompous. She had a wonderful idea which could have been made better. Sue Bender, you need to grow up."
257,3,Hang upside down!,"These are nifty little fellas, but they do 'leak' a bit, so you either have to get something else to set them on or make sure everyone always hangs them upside down.They tend to forget, and then you have a mess on the floor.I would have considered giving four stars, but the magnets don't do any good if there is nothing for them to 'cling' to, and because they do leak. But they are cute and somewhat handy.Oh, and they could grind a wee bit better. But not bad overall."
258,2,Unfulfilled potential,"As light weight sci-fi/horror anthologies go this is probably good value for money (given its low price), but the apparent lack of good editing and of proper proof reading is painfully evident and you definitely won't find any candidate for a Hugo or Nebula award.You'll find a couple of interesting ideas, a lot of trite and derivative ones and occasionally some baffling lack of coherent character development.There's enough to show that Messrs. Jason Brannon, Eric S. Brown and John Grover have the potential to write something good, but it seems to be, at the moment at least, unfulfilled potential."
259,4,Comprehensive Introduction,Logically enough Professor Herrick begins with an overview of his subject. He concludes with some of the better known modern rhetoricians. In between these two chapters he traces the history of the field and the various contributors. Timelines in the chapters enable the reader to see where the content of that particular section fits in the overall scheme. Sources are clearly identified throughout the book. Sidebars are another asset found in each section.The glossary in the back of the book is a ready reference for students seeking to quickly understand a term. Herrick seeks to combine modern example with ancient methodology in some places. Generally speaking this book introduces the subject well. It is clear and comprehensive. I have used with favorable results as a textbook when I was teaching in Massachusetts.
260,5,BP Rocks the House,"This is an excellent resource for scouting baseball players for the upcoming season. Literally you get this book for $15, and compared with the magazines you get for $8, it is a great value. The book is full of stats you can't get anywhere else. Some in particular that I find valuable are the Groundball Percentages and new 'Stuff' rankings for pitchers.They also don't just give you numbers, but supply you with a scouting report on pretty much any player who is likely to play in the majors in the upcoming season including minor leaguers.Easily worth the $15 if you are trying to win a fantasy baseball league."
261,3,"Good collection, great bargain!","My 5 year old son loves I Spy, so the Easter bunny brought him this collection of 4 I Spy books in one volume. He is a beginning reader, and the pictures next to the words help to reinforce his reading skills. That said, the searches are pretty easy for him. His 3 year old sister breezes through them quickly as well using the pictures in the list. They like to race to see who can find the objects fastest, but they have both mastered the entire volume since Easter, just over a week ago."
262,5,The Dolla$ Are Best When Dirty!,"Chopper Girl is on fire! This album, her debut, is packed full of topics, tempos, lyrics, collabos, and crunkness! This woman is living proof that Memphis Rap is NOT dead, but alive, well, and thriving! There wasn't a song on this album that I didn't like. I'm telling you, ""Dirty Dolla$"" is a MUST have for all the TRUE Memphis Rap Bumpers."
263,1,There are not very many books I hate. This is one of them.,"I find this books to be incredibly disrespectful of it's own contents. The information is at best laughable and at worst horrifyingly stupid.Others have mentioned the concept of the 'new' triple Deities(as everyone knows that you can create deities just by reading about them in a book and wanting them to exist *real* hard). I also found the concept that these deities would be thrilled with offerings of trash and garbage particularly 'interesting'(by which I mean nonsensical and silly.)This book is garbage of the lowest common denominator. A sheer money grab by a person who lives in a self created commune in a rural area. If I could chose one book to permanently remove from all bookstores and shelves this would be seriously in the running for that spot. Dare I say it - worse then SWR if only because everyone knows she writes garbage whereas people, for some reason, think this is the best stuff ever."
264,1,Don't Waste Your Money,"First of all you have to already have a pretty stiff erection to get this thing on. Secondly, we've used it twice and the third time we went to use it one of the dolphin heads split apart from the main ring. We've washed it both times we used it with toy cleaner - nothing harsh. It's cheaply made and the batteries do not last at all. Once it was on it really didn't do what it is supposed to do - it's more awkward than anything. Definitely would not recommend."
265,5,Wonderful Pattern,This is a great pattern for a special occasion or every day use... well worth it!!!
266,4,103 Great Poems Meistergedichte Johann Wolfgang von GOethe,"Perfect for anyone who wants to read Goethe's peotry in German and understand it as well. For those familar with the German language, Goethe isn't the easiest writer to understand in German."
267,5,One of my all-time favorites,"If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time."
268,3,A great read,I read a lot about this period in history so this book was a bit out of the ordinary but interesting.
269,1,Does not work,"According to the specifications this headset supports Bluetooth 1.2, as well as the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and the Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). I could not get any sound to come out when connected with my Sony Ericsson w600i in phone or Walkman mode, and people could not hear me when I called them. I tried every setting possible, read the instructional booklets for each device and the thing still wouldn't to anything when connected. I am guessing that this headset works fantastically with any Motorola device, but as far as I'm concerned this product is guilty of false advertising. After this experience I do not plan on buying any Motorola Bluetooth devices."
270,5,Don't you wish you could write like him?,"Cold Dog Soup is typical Guy Clark; literate, tuneful, wry, funny, brilliantly crafted, wonderfully played. Opening with the title tune, Clark's images invade your mind and don't let you go. Fort Worth Blues and Sis Draper follow inviting the listener on a journey with a group of fascinating characters. Men will be boys takes a playful putdown and turns it into a celebration of helling around sung as a bunch of guys having way too much fun.""The only difference between men and the boysis the size of their feet and the price of their toys""Very well played, lots of great guitar and mandolin playing. Highly recommend"
271,5,Great History Refresher,"A much needed refresher of what makes our country great, the philosophy our founders found to be crucial to the makings of a republic."
272,4,Good read,"Nice suspense, unexpected story line that leaves reader wondering about a conclusion . Good characters and setting descriptions. Any true western affciano will enjoy the fighting and promise of action.Dan G"
273,4,Works perfectly but difficult to install,I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. The original board was permanently fastened to the opener chassis and had to be cut off. I then had to drill holes in the side of the opener and fasten the new board with two screws. Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs.
274,5,a wonderful cd,"i've owned this cd for years, and it keeps returning to my now playing selection. its wonderful to listen to in the morning as i'm waking up, while i'm reading, or just feeling extremely lazy. i highly recommend it."
275,5,indeed one of the most impressive CD of 1998,"Thanks to amazon.com I found this record. It is one of the rare records you can play over and over without boring. Only this fact merits five stars. It sometimes reminds me to Haris Alexiou (greek female artist). I recommend this CD to anyone who is searching for an intriguing sound not influenced by marketing. I cannot describe, just listen, and you'll know what I mean."
276,5,Esta genial..,"Esta genial este compact.. Sin tener conocimiento previo del grupo nadie pudiera adivinar la nacionalidad de los artistas.. tiene obvias influencias españolas pero a la vez un son latino y un giro primermundista en su filosofia. Resulta que es una Judia-Mexicana-Americana-Canadiense.. indescribible su musica, utiliza lluvia, guitarra, y mil sonidos para expresarse."
277,3,a fun adventure,Except for being very much likeThe Indian in the Cupboardthe book has a sword and sorcery type theme.The adventure is fun and the characters are believable.I liked the book and thought it was fun reading.The diagram of the castle was also educational;pretty small for a Keep. Most real castles were much larger than this.
278,5,the castle is my all time favorite book!,"This book was the best book to read it kept me on the edge of my seat! I couln't wait to finish and to see what happened and when it ended i wanted to read it again. If you like fantasies i would highly recement this book. It's about a boy named William and his ""nanny"" and very close friend gave him a castle and he adored it! When he relized that the castle had secrets to learn he became a part of the castle. If you want to know more than bye the book!!"
279,5,I love Lisa Smith's books!!!!!,Spellbinder was the first book I read by Lisa Smith. It made me read all of the Night World series not to mention buy all her others!! I like reading books about withcraft and if you do you will love this book. It was great!! So read it!!
280,3,1 1/2 inlet connection,"the hose end for the wall connection was over sized, i had to sand it down with emery cloth to make it fit properly, otherwise the hose was good"
281,5,What A Difference!!,"Finally replaced our 20+ year old central vac hose with this one and WOW...what a difference! The handle and the on/off switch really take a lot of effort out of this chore. Highly recommend!! Now, if only someone would invent an easy way of storing these things!"
282,4,Tomb raider Angel of Darkness,Game was in excellent condition. It is not as much fun as the true tomb raider series as it has no secret passages nor many surprises.
283,2,Don't bother,"This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles."
284,1,when is this game going to be released??,"I can hardly wait for this game and now another disappointment,why don't they be truthful and say when for sure so I can get on with some other game..just waiting with baited-breath, and how long will we have to wait for another after this one,, they need to get with it before I outgrow my need for Laura and I'm only 75 , can't wait much longer, if you know what I mean!!!"
285,2,Tomb Stinker - Eidos' Revenge,"Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. This game is proof.The graphics are beautiful, which accounts for the extra star for the overall rating. If you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will absolutely hate this game, as I do. The controls, the plot, and the movements are maddening, boring and confusing, respectively. Eidos could plug Tomb Raider 1 into this engine and have a much more interesting game.Maxim magazine gave this game 5 stars. A good reason to ignore Maxim's ratings."
286,4,excellent,"Yes, there are parts that are a bit tricky. If you don't like a challenge don't bother with it but it is very involving and well laid out. Great story line with wonderfully interactive characters all providing enough clues and goodies to keep the game moving.If you like intelligent, challenging games then this one will be for you, otherwise just stick with the kiddie stuff."
287,1,Piece of CR--AP - try calling their support !,Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. It failed even the assembly test - the thing is so badly manufactured that the connection to which the pressure hose connects on the body of the washer was completely misaligned. There was no way I could connect the nozzle. OK - I thought it happens. I tried to call their 1-800-521-8559 support number and was on hold for 42 Minutes both on the Customer Service and Sales lines and then they cut me off. I did not even talk to a human! Their website is a joke. This is a typical bottom of the barrel Chinese company trying to dump poorly built stuff on the consumer. DO NOT BUY this and encourage such companies that dont give a hoot about the customer.I'm returning this and telling every retailer to dump this.AM
288,2,Kindle Buyer Beware!,"Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here."
289,3,Annabel Lee,"I think it was emotional and she was sick and really ill after catching a chill on a beach,the authoris mourning the death of his lover.in my opinion it was sad,but a great book.there is alot of romance. It was kind of hard toread because i'm only 9 and I had to have someone explain the story to me."
290,4,Even our 23 Month Old Likes It,"My son was covering ""bugs"" in preschool, so I picked up this book. Knowing it was going to be really for older kids, I wasnt sure he was going to like it. These books are so well designed however that for 2 weeks now, he requests the ""bug"" book every night before bed. The only problem is that the pictures are so detailed and zoomed in that some of the images gives my wife and I the heebeegeevees.The other great thing, is that this book will be a great book from him to grow into.We are picking up more!"
291,4,Plenty of pics and info,"I have an avid seven year old reader. With all the little captions and detailed drawing, etc- he has been reading and rereading this book and loving it."
292,1,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION,"The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"
293,2,An opportunity missed,"I'm sorry to say this CD is not very representative of Jewish liturgical music in England. There are far too many modern pieces by contemporary Jewish composers, many of which would be considered quite out of place in an actual English synagogue service, particularly of the more traditional style. The leading composers of the Anglo-Jewish liturgical tradition such as Samuel Alman and Abraham Saqui are very poorly represented; even Israel Mombach, the English equivalent of Solomon Sulzer or Louis Lewandowski, only has 3 pieces on the album - and only one of those is typical. Finally, several of the pieces are instrumental (for organ) without any singing at all, which has little relevance to the choral music of the album's title.I have heard the Zemel Choir live, and on this CD they seem rather recessed and timid. Overall, a disappointing release."
294,2,Bad quality,"I read a previous review that said hers got a run the first time she used them and I figured I'd just be more careful...mine got a run the second time I used them! Unless you're desperate, don't bother. I expected better quality for the price I paid!"
295,5,Fawlty Towers on Holiday,"A humorous account of the author's travels circa 1983 to the remaining possessions of the British Empire, almost all of which are isolated islands. Several of the tiffs with British bureaucrats read like episodes of British sitcoms. My only complaint is that the bibliography at the end was not updated for the re-issue and is composed entirely of books which are more than 20 years old."
296,2,Characters are stagnant and boring. Not fun.,"I cannot believe that this book has won awards. I like certain passages; Ms. Scott's imagery is often good and the ""mood"" is earthy and dark. However, overall it was disappointing. I just finished it and I could hardly wait to put it down and move onto something more interesting. Ms. Scott desperately tries to make her characters more than cardboard cutouts, but she never manages to succeed. I found myself not caring about the fate of any of these people or the house they lived in (which is really the main ""character"" of the book).The author has mastery of language but the story, like the mounted animals in the book, is merely the pretty arrangement of skin with no guts inside. No life."
297,1,Atrocious.,"I purchased this on a whim because, hey, I like Billie Holiday... so remixes could be fun, right? I couldn't have been more wrong. What was done to this music can only be described as a travesty at best - an ugly cacophony of cheap electro beats over Billie's beautiful voice. This could have been done well. There's great potential, but this? Not even passable. Don't even give this one a second glance."
298,3,Functional but flimsy,This product is great if what you are using it for isn't too heavy or lopsided. The frame is very flimsy but with a few modifications like clamps to hold the upper circle in place and a weld to hold the supports together it is a very useful item for picking up leaf debris or even heavier items like wet trash.
299,1,It is OK but not great.,The directions to put this together were unclear and failed to note that you need to use really oversized bags. After a few uses the sides have already broken. The clips are really hard to put on and off the the rack.
300,4,Good Product,"Confusing to assemble; also, tighten screws well, or you'll lose the, and will have to replace at the hardware store.But once you get you get it together, it works well."
301,3,Typo of main character on the back of this edition,"The synopsis on the back of this edition misspells one of the main character's names, Will Farnaby. It says 'Faranby' two different times. Hopefully someone has done something about this by now."
302,5,.,"wonderful book, recommend this to anyone looking for a great novel to sit and get lost in... check it out!"
303,2,Didactic melodrama,"I have read enough to know when I'm being preached to, and Huxley is unsuccessful in masking his assertions re: the human condition in The Island. I was very disappointed, since Huxley has the ability to write well, even about esoteric subjects (see The Perennial Philosophy, for instance), but ends up just making a hash of it here. Not highly recommended."
304,2,Have any reviewers actually read this?,"The synopsis of this book sounded spectacular, a conspiring journalist gets stuck on a utopian island. The book starts off kind of entertaining but with a bit of rambling but you figure as you go on, it will probably subside. It doesn't. The characters keep going on and on about buddhism, sex and mushrooms. The plot barely starts and barely ends. This is a book with no journey and no destination."
305,5,"exploration of the here and now, the there and later",A man arrives on an Island to engineer an oil deal. He begins to like the place. It is a nice place. But one of the old money family wants to sell it out for greater access to the contents of a Sears-Roebuck catalog. In the end evil triumphs because good is pacifist and big oil money can buy more guns.
306,4,Aldous Huxley questions the modern society yet again..,"Like in his famous novel ""Brave New World"", this is a utopian story, however in this case it is not a negative Utopia. Set on a tropical island and told from the point of view of a jaded journalist secretly helping an oil company interested in concessions, it explores Buddhist religion and possible alternatives to our lifestyle. No great revelations, but then, noone has the answers. A good read for Huxley fans and people who enjoy utopian stories"
307,1,"Dull, dull, dull. Slog you way thru. If you can.",Disappointing. Very. Nothing happens. Huxley pontificates. Spare me. Can see why he's only known for one book. Skip this one.
308,1,Not this one,"I found this book annoying. It probably has some good points, and even some helpful points, but I was annoyed with the tone of voice of the author. Give parents some credit, for heaven's sake! I read a group of 10 books about teaching gifted children, and there are so many better choices that I would not recommend this one."
309,1,Home Video,"A woman (with a child in a state of perpetual tantrum) straps a camera to a stroller to see who will help her carry it. This is a video about how one person's poor planning can become everyone's problem! I looked for the story in it, but couldn't find one, so I shut it off."
310,2,Top 10,"This book doesn't make sense. I am pretty sure Christians already have a Top 10 list if you know what I mean. I bet THE MAN is pretty upset about this. James Moore went all Casey Kasem on him and tried to trump HIS list. Anyway, it's your call, but I think I'm sticking with the list that dates back to B.C. and has guided the morals of man ever since, while playing a major role the development of early legal systems which has an impact present in almost all forms of modern law and faith.Nice try James Moore."
311,1,Seriously flawed AI and interface killed the game,It is an excellent concept completely spoiled by bad design!In the heat of the battle an extra click on already selected group can select ALL of you troups and instead a single move/attack you have all your army moving to a position. In this time the CPU kills you with ease.There is no EASY way to tell the arches to shoot a specific target. Especially if there are 10 enemy troops rushing towards you in a pack. As a result they don't shoot the critical ladders but some stupid axeman. Short while after that you have all the ladders on your walls and in a minute all the enemy army is in your camp. Even if you survive this then it is real pain to target the ladders on the walls. You can spend a minute to shoot down one and the CPU does not wait that much.THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME!
312,2,I second that!,"I agree with the review dated March 14, 1999. I'd also like to add that as of Chapter 2, I've found at least three misprints in the solutions manual. Normally, these types of mistakes are not that much of a problem. But this should be unacceptable for any decent technical writing, especially mathematics."
313,4,smaller than expected.. but fun,"Thought the football would be a bit larger, but that would be my fault for not ""reading""... cute, fun and very loud!!!"
314,4,I loved it!,Hi! Ok well I just ordered this book again for a niece of mine. I have the book at home and I just love it the instructions are so easy to follow! I would recomend this to anyone who loves beautiful fashionable jewlery!
315,1,"Beware the words ""digitally remastered""",If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. I turned it off after 5 tracks because I couldn't bare to listen to it any more. I had the feeling that someone had rummaged through some old discarded session tapes and had played them back through a pillow. The arrangements were definitely not what I was expecting and the quality was awful. I gave this recoding 1 star but only because they wouldn't let me out of the screen without filling in that field!
316,3,Size,"I ordered a particular size and was sent the wrong size. Returning the jeans to the USA from Belgium at my own expense is not really an option. Unfortunately the seller claimed the error was mine and that it sent the size I ordered. The problem is, when you check the status of the order on the Amazon site, it gives you every detail of your order - date, type of product, quantity, price, expected delivery date. BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE DETAILS OF THE SIZE YOU ORDERED. So, you have no proof that it is the seller's error not your own. So, I have 2 pairs of jeans that don't fit me."
317,4,My first stockings - These are great!,"I am 5'5"" and about 160 lbs. I got the size Queen 1 because of the reviews saying to get a size up since they cut into your thigh. I am wearing these with a garter belt under a dress so I needed them to fit comfortably. I got nude, and I am very pale and the color works. They aren't too shiny either. This size is supposed to fit up to 225 lbs and 5'6"" and they fit pretty well on my thigh but the lace band sits pretty low. It starts just a few inches above my knee, so keep that in mind. You will need adjustable garter straps and a knee length dress. I can't wait to try these on with my garter and dress!"
318,5,Classic Calla is a must have!!!,I've owned this specific set of china for the past 6 years and absolutely love it!!! I've had no problems of chipping or cracking and the set is used and placed into the dishwasher on a regular basis. I fell in love with the pattern and it doesn't disappoint! Another fine product from Mikasa.
319,5,"The meaning of God, the meaning of life.","Both of these issues, among others, are examined in this simple yet complex story about a variety of characters, all of whom we recognize.What lies beneath the skin of the average person? What do they believe in, and why? What makes their worlds shatter? What would make your world shatter?The author never wastes a word, entertwining the characters in unlikely but believable ways. It's a quick read that lingers with the reader, to make you think about your beliefs, and what you would do for those beliefs.To each individual, the book could be about God, or the meaning of life, or simply how you fit into the world. This makes the book touching on a personal level. I think every reader will find a different way, and reason, to love this book."
320,3,my review,"In this story, Hyacinth is a woman who is faced with one of the most horrible moments in a mother's life: she is forced to give up her two children for a moment of craziness she already regrets.Faced with an incredible emptiness, she is able, with the help of a total stranger, to rebuild her life. what once seemed an impossibility becomes her career and she is good at it.The story is interesting and the plot keeps you interested till the end. It makes a good summer reading."
321,4,After The Fire,I was hooked from the first page to this novel. It wasn't until the last 30 pages that I had an idea of how this might end. I really enjoyed the read. I read alot and really enjoyed this one
322,3,"Plain and Predicatable, but still worth reading","If I hadn't read other books by Belva Plain, I would give this book 5 stars. It was a good book, but she has done so much better in books like Evergreen and Legacy of Silence. This was a fast read (I did it in 3 days, along with working 8 hours each day and studying) and I was wrapt until the middle of the book, when I realized exactly what was going to happen. I finished the book, with hopes that I was incorrect. I was disappointed with the transparent climax, but overall this is worthwhile, especially if you haven't read any of Plain's greater works or can forget that you have."
323,4,Great deal!,"Great deal for the price. I have not had a chance to use it yet, as I could not find a set in my budget until fireplace season was over. However, my 12yr old was able to easily assemble the set and it looks nice and feels sturdy."
324,1,Wasted money,"The subject is trivial and boring. The writing skill mediocre.I was stuck in Sri Lanka and downloaded it by mistake when learning how to use my new kindle. Decided to take a look.Sorry, perhaps just not my type of book. It is no literature."
325,1,Too boring to finish,I got this as a free selection. It was so incredibly boring and I could not finish it. Don't waste any amount of money on it.
326,4,Well-written and thought-provoking,"Although I read this book many years ago I recall that it is a well-written and engaging examination of women's sexuality. The difficulties that many young women face as they mature into fully functioning sexual adults - as mitigated by their upbringings as well as the varied expectations of society and their partners - are nicely illustrated through a series of real life case studies. The author, Dr. Bardon, was a teaching and research member of the faculty of the University of Minnesota from the early 1960s through the late 1990s. Some of the book will undoubtedly be dated, but much of it is just as relevant -...- today as when it was written in the mid 1970s. As used copies are readily available through Amazon.com I highly recommend picking one up."
327,1,"I wanted to love it, but...",I couldn't. The quality of this DVD is horrible! It was like watching an old old old VHS tape. I'm not surprised it was so cheap but I'm shocked that it was rated 4 and a half stars when I bought it. I was taken for a ride and it wasn't on the back of a horse.
328,2,Way too flimsy to be on your desk,"There's a reason this thing is $15. It's made of ultra-cheap material and it shows from a mile. The stones look to be collected from around some highway. In addition to that, mine had an unbalanced stand which made it jiggle when playing with the sand. I returned it and will keep looking for something that is not an embarrassment when noticed by coworkers."
329,1,Cheaply made,"Like other reviewers, my zen garden arrived with the bottom falling apart. Had I tried to add the sand, it would have poured out the bottom. It was so visibly defective that I'm shocked that it made it out of the factory. I sent it back."
330,2,Terriable.,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this! When I got the product, I had before-hand read some reviews about it falling apart or something. So, before I wasted the sand that came with it and caused a mess, I gently pressed on the wood/base part. It was flimsy, but I didn't think much of it. Then, while just doing a quick look over, I noticed that there was a small disconect between the bottom base and the black lining. This would cause the sand to leak out of the crack! Then, the base fell write off! I noticed that it had very tiny, small metal pieces that had wood from the base around it. I now realize that they probably put the metal into it, painted the top black, then pushed on the base to connect the two parts. The little ""stubs"" that hold it up have superglue stains from where they glued it to the bottom of the base. How cheap! I really don't know what to do now. I'll probably get my dad to put some nails in it. Really, the Dollar Tree would probably make a better structure!"
331,3,It's OK,"I covers most or all 1911's by most or all manufacturers. My mistake, hoping that it was all going to be about Colt 1911's. picture quality not too good ."
332,4,Good for Sony Video Camera,This is an excellent tripod for Sony Video Camera. I am using this with my Sony Camcorder and remote is working pretty good. Its legs are strong. I am using the same with my Nikon D50( remote is not usable). And I am satisfied with the performance. only one issue is the base where you attach camera is plastic. So sometimes I am not comfortable with my DSLR with its zoom lens
333,5,Well-crafted thriller,This is an extremely well written thriller that left me in a slight daze by the time I was finished. A great aspect of this book is that the ending is totally unpredictable.
334,5,The CD that signaled PUR's breakthrough is still a classic,"PUR, now Germany's most popular band, had originally never planned on releasing a live album, but by 1992 their audience's calls for one became too loud to be ignored and PUR Live was recorded during a Germany-wide tour.From older pieces like ""Drachen sollen fliegen"" and ""Fallen"" to the songs that even relatively new PUR fans know by heart (""Lena"" or ""Ohne Dich""), the band exemplifies its talents and hard work by producing stupendous songs live and without the benefit of a high-tech studio.PUR Live became the band's most successful CD only weeks after its release. Now aware of the band and its quality music and lyrics, audiences in Germany and elsewhere have since then turned all of PUR's CDs into record setting ones."
335,1,coffee mugs?,"Of the six glass mugs, I have two left, And am very careful if I use them for any kind of liquid I put in it, be it cold or hot,seams will leak,If the liquid is hot it will split the cup,Do not enjoy a hot coffee bath, As far as I am conserned its a waste of money, but it is your life. not impressed. B.Uzzell Arvada, Colordo"
336,4,Interesting,"Country of Exiles is a fascinating book, though I'm not sure Leach's arguments add up. He identifies and analyzes certain aspects of our society, but I'm not sure these aspects are central to the rootlessness that is undeniably a central tenet of our modern-day living. Tourism and casinos as the cause of this shiftless life? I don't think so.....but his notes and observations on both of these is informative and fascinating. (I particularly liked his endnotes--half as long as the text, citing every single source; very reassuring.) I want to be critical of this book, but I recognize that there's something there in what he's written. I just finished reading it, and already I want to skim through it again and reread certain passages--which means that this is one book that provokes one into thinking, which can't be all bad."
337,1,More Fiction than fact,"Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of ""Billy the Kid"" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy."
338,4,"Very funny, but not his best","Wet Work is one of Buckley's earlier works. I personally prefer his later works, but that is me. I'm still a sucker for anything Buckley writes. At first I thought the dialog was somewhat confusing, but as I read on the characters took over and the story became even funnier.In my opinion the ending was one of his best. Wet Work as a whole wasn't Buckley's best, but it was still worth my time to read it.The slower than usual start was the reason for four stars (4.5, but I'm not rounding)."
339,1,!!!! Wrong MP3 files !!!!,The MP3 files downloadable from this site are not for Parsifal but Verdi's Traviata. Amazon needs to fix this urgently.
340,5,Good Price,"It's hard to review a product like this...don't have a can of carbon monoxide to test it with! So, on faith alone, I'm going to say I like it! I bought this particular model because I don't like being tied to the battery makers, and, as opposed to a fire/smoke alarm that you would still want to work even if the power went out, I really don't see the advantage of having a battery backup for a CO monitor...the power goes out and the ability to make CO pretty much goes away, too. Anyway, good (I hope!) product at a good price...I recommend it!"
341,4,Good value for price,"Simple, no batteries to replace, But should have 7 yrs life instead of 5 like the old ones did."
342,1,Broke after first day of use,"Got hot and smelled like burning ozone after plugging in. A dissapointing product, never got any real use out of it. Do not recommend."
343,4,Great value!,"I got six of these. They were painless to install and don't take up the entire outlet plate. Took off a star because I could not stand the time-consuming plastic, sealed packaging they come in."
344,2,"""THE ROCKETS RED GLARE"" ???","This over-priced pain in ""the sitting area"" has an always-on, glaring RED light.*Red lights are commonly used to warn of an immediate danger that requires attention NOW.*NO-I don't have a carbon Monoxide problem. The red light also stayed on for a week when I plugged it in to an outside plug."
345,4,Good product.,"Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
346,4,not bad,"Very easy to use, just plug in. Currently it hasn't alarmed yet. You can test it if you push the button."
347,4,Sony VCT870RM Tripod w/Remote,Tripod is stable. It has strong locking mechanism on the legs. Pan and tilt is very adjustable for smooth movement. Locking mechanism for camera (Sony 403) is easy to connect and engage. Remote control functions and handle are easy to operate and worked with no problems.
348,1,Cheap along with poor customer service,"I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!"
349,2,ho hum,"If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore."
350,2,don't waste your money,"I had several of these as a kid and never had a problem. This one was defective out of the box! When i tried to put the rocket on the pump and lock it in place the air pump nipple snapped off and rendered the toy useless. After further inspection i found that the rocket itself was the cause. The plastic ring at the base that attaches to the pump was deformed and would not mount on the pump properly, when i slid the pump lock over the mount it started to bind and snapped the nipple off.I packaged it up and returned it.I may try some of the other models to see how they stack up."
351,1,Broke immediately,It's hard to write a full 20 words on a toy that broke on the very first use leaving me with a cheap piece of plastic and a crying five year old.
352,4,Good showing of Tibetian medicine,My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet.
353,4,Decent product,"I ordered the largest size of the sock but my cast is too big for it to completely go over the entire thing. However, it does cover my toes and keeps them warm. Overall, I'm a happy camper with these. If you have a smaller cast, they work perfectly.Pedifix Stretch Socks"
354,4,Good buy.,Comfortable and long lasting. This saved the cost of replacing my current mattress. Worked well on an adjustable bed. Highly recommended.
355,3,"Great for the first few years, until...","I had the same experience as reviewer Derek G, only without the attempt to claim the warranty. My Twin size really was wonderful for sleeping, until just about the 5-year mark. Then sleeping hurt because of the me-shaped divot, and only about 4 inches along the sides were still firm. Cheaper and likely much less of a hassle to just give it up as a short-term thing and buy another one, or another brand, to replace it."
356,3,Zombie Lover,"I enjoyed the book itself, the writing always captures and maintains my interest. I usually read these books in one or two days. I have been pleased with Xanth books from the beginning and have not missed a volume. The reason that this book only received three stars from me is the cover art. The story depicts Breanna as a very dark skinned young woman. The cover depicts her as a pale faced girl with dirty or hairy arms and legs. A little more consistancy between the artist and the illustrator would appropriate and appreciated.I am amazed to find that what seems like such a minor detail is so incremental in causing this book to lose two stars from my vote.Piers and publishers, you cannot present a wonderfully diverse setting if the marketing on the front tries to appeal to only one group, by making the black character look almost white."
357,5,Another Excellent Achievment,"This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book."
358,2,"Zombie Lover or Sex,Sex,Sex","This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite ""white girl"" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book."
359,5,Works great - simple yet effective.,"I got this because I wanted a good quality gray card that wasn't made of paper and would last a while. I don't really need the white or black cards, or the deluxe lanyard (it really is nice quality though), and i basically just threw the card in my bag and left the rest at home. Kind of pricey for a piece of plastic, but if you are in the field shooting in JPG mode and need to do a custom white balance, it's worth it to me, even if it fixes just one shot. The card works great. I've used it several times already and it is a simple but effective way to adjust white balance in strange lighting situations."
360,4,Comes with Donald engine and coal tender car,"This does not come with a Thomas and gold Thomas as pictured, but rather with a black wooden Donald engine and matching coal tender car with the number ""9"" on the side. If you look closely you will see on the DVD box pictured that it says ""Donald"" above the pocket that holds the trains so I was expecting this and was not disappointed, however, if you want the trains in the picture you won't get them. That said, the video is a Thomas video and our 2 year old loves it, it contains 7 episodes and a running time of 39 minutes, plus 60 minutes of ""bonus features"" such as 2 sing-along songs, a ""DVD game"" called Sodor Spelling Game and a ""chracter gallery"". I haven't checked these out. Overall a great deal as long as you are expecting a Donald set!"
361,1,dissapointment,If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows.
362,3,Cute costume,"This runs big, the headband is very cheap and not what appears in the picture, but it works and your little girl won't know the difference. The boots will also be very long and go up to their thighs unless you have a very tall 5 or 6 year old. The dress is also big however with the tie belt that comes with it you can pin up the dress. I think I would have gone down a size if I had to do it again.Overall, my girl loves it and she is very happy with it."
363,1,Huge & Unreliable,"I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !"
364,2,very bad movie/DVD quality,"I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality."
365,1,Uhhh.,I can not be certain but I don't think the other reviewers and I saw the same movie. Acting was terrible video was terrible plot was terrible. Good try I guess.
366,1,This was a waste of time.,"Let's keep this simple: promising plot ruined by -Bad acting.Poor and often ignorant dialogue (scripting).Inconsistent plot elements (slow walking zombies, then fast ones, then back to slow).An inhabited island overrun by zombies, yet not a SINGLE boat was available anywhere.Piss poor directing.What else is there left to say?"
367,2,Not good for showers,"Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."
368,3,tension rod for shower curtain,"With a very narrow, fiberglass shower, it's been difficult finding a tension rod for the curtain. This one installed easily but it doesn't stay up as well as I'd like. I resolved that by using a small square of ""Gripliner"" under each end which seems to be working well. That may not be as attractive as I would want but it does the job."
369,1,Poor Quality,"This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
370,2,A Disappointing Misrepresentation,"Baking With Julia is an AMAZING Book.It is an exceptionally well written resource that is an accurate reflection of the PBS televised series of same name.When I stumbled onto the option to order a DVD [suposedly of the full series] on the book's writter, Dorie Greenspan I ordered it immediately!!Well, the DVD arrived today and it is only a minute fraction [i.e., only 8 shows from this far more extensive series] selection of the books recipes. What a misleading dissapointment - as I expected when I place the order for this dvd that it reflected the full series ... nothing in the product description indicated otherewise.Would I still purchase it if I knew up front that it was not the full series ... probably yes ... because I love Julia as well as the series and the book.However, the nature of this post is ""Buyer beware"""
371,4,"Good, but not the complete series","This ""Baking with Julia"" Dvd is delightful as are all of Julia's programs. Seeing her interact with expert Bakers is very entertaining and informative. My only complaint is that it is not the entire Series and therefore is not nearly a true companion to the Cookbook ""Baking with Julia"" from the same series. There are only 8 of the 24 episodes included. Each one is masterfully filmed, crisp and clear and the food photos are luscious and mouthwatering as the finished products are presented. The ""Baking with Julia 2"" Dvd has been released and still only contains 8 more programs. I hope that they will hurry and complete the set- but regret that they didn't just make the entire series available to begin with. It is for that reason only that I give it a 4 rather than 5 star rating."
372,1,Shoddy Disks,"The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job."
373,5,Breathtaking,"Bryan Wilson's solo album is just in words I can't explain but breathtaking. He is truly anointed by God. If this brotha keeps doing albums like this, he is going to tear the scene in gospel music."
374,4,Book was recommended by a close friend,"Hard to rate a book. But the Amazon service was excellent. I obviously wish I did not need to order it. I have not read it yet, but an initial browse showed it will probably help a lot if I get serious about it. Price was hard to beat, and its condition was like new. I could not tell it was a used book."
375,5,Required Reading,"I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!"
376,5,Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars,Excellent book...well worth reading by anyone battling diabetes either type and by anyone concerned for someone who is in that situation.I have battled diabetes for over 7 years now and am fairly well read but Dr Bernstein has taught me fresh ways to battle the situation.Delighted with the speedy service.RegardsRoy N.
377,4,I think you're missing the point.,"I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?"
378,4,A peek inside the process.,"First thing's first, ""Homespun"" is an album of demos for ""Apple Venus"". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, ""Skylarking"" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for ""Apple Venus"". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (""Frivolous Tonight"") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts ""River of Orchids"" and ""Green Man"".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (""Knights in Shining Karma""), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out ""Apple Venus"", it's a fine record."
379,4,16 OZ CAPACITY IS MISLEADING...,"These lovely glass mugs comfortably hold approx. 12 ozs. I contacted manuafacturer inquiring why the mugs were advertised as 16 oz capacity when they hold only 12 and was advised they measure all the way to the brim. Yep, I tried it and the mug will hold that amount but you won't be able to pick it up without spilling it!I'm keeping them as they are easy to keep clean."
380,1,Not for Boiling Liquids?????????,"I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful."
381,5,Professionally done,"For beginners like us, this is a wonderful video. It is visually appealing. The instruction is paced just right and clear in all respects."
382,1,How Not to become a good Argentine Tango dancer,"This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Even ballroom dancing has now a separate category for Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, this video is not that. That's why, I rate it at 1."
383,5,A Local Fan's Review,"I've only been a Texas Rangers fan since 1994, and my wife gave me this book as a present in 1997. I knew the Texas Rangers existed before I came to live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Texas area, but I never thought much of them. I didn't realize the characters and history of the team. If you're a casual Rangers fan, or a die hard Rangers fan, then you should have this book. It's filled with all kinds of informational pieces about the team's history, going back to the early 70's when they were the Washington Senators. Focuses heavily on the 1996 season in which they finally made it to the playoffs after about 25 years."
384,5,fun!,"This is a great book, fun and full of significance. I can still see the main character riding his bike ""Bice"" and feel his loneliness. Very ironic the way in which the author describe everyday life: you will love it!"
385,2,Not as good as most,"I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
386,1,Do Not Buy This Software!,"I tried this software as an alternative to ULead's DVD PictureShow. The good news: DVD Photoplay makes it easier to load pictures into a slide show project than ULead's software.The bad news: THE SOFTWARE DOESN'T WORK. I've tested the program on three computers: An IBM Laptop with a HP USB CD Writer, a Dell desktop with an internal CD Writer, and a Sony VAIO desktop with an internal CD Writer. Whenever I tried to write the project to CD, the software failed to recognize my CD Writer on each machine.I emailed customer support, and though I was assured I would receive an answer within 3 days, 10 days later I still haven't heard from them.I wish I had kept my receipt so that I could get my money back for this worthless software..."
387,4,Superb.,I like the video quality. the story and the performances are great! The special effects are amazing. I am happy to this as part of my collection.
388,4,Great Set at a good price,"This set was great - as soon as I got it I called people over and watched Spiderman 3. It's a little hokey, yes, but it looked so good that no one even cared. The picture is spectacular, the sound is great, and the price wasn't bad at all (around $60). I'd definately recommend this to anyone interested in getting the movies. I'll never buy another regular DVD again! Upconverting is for chumps - get BluRay and never look back!"
389,2,did not purchase,why am I being asked to review a product I didn't purchase. Need to fix the system or allow me to delete the request.
390,4,Spiderman trilogy,"I ordered these for my son, he loves them! He watches them all the time and takes them everywhere he goes. They were such a good price and the shipping was reasonable and fast."
391,5,Great dance music,"They were good.Early Miami Club Sound. Later to be imitated by others. Listening to their music makes me want to be back and re-live my youth,my club scene days. Saw them perform live.Before the Beach as we called it became ""South Beach"".If you want fun dance music then find this cd.If you were around at that time it will bring back memories."
392,5,Excellent cable to assist in transfers of your videos to PC,Excellent method for transfering your videos to your computer for editing and making CD's. The i.Link cable is easy to use. Make sure you order the right cable. I ordered the wrong cable a 4 pin to 4 pin which I believe only works if you have a Sony computer. Most other computers like my Dell will probally need the 6 pin to 4 pin cable.Also make sure your computer has the capability before ordering. i.LINK is also known as Firewire and IEEE-1394.It does provide excellent high speed quality video transfers.
393,5,Drive safely!,"Very good driving game, good graphics and physics, although FlatOut2 is of course better. I only got this cause I went thru all of flatout2 and needed more! Only complaint: too much ""dirt"" driving, I prefer cities and concrete. Also, it seems a bit harder than FlatOut2, but I am getting thru it in time."
394,2,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you.","If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
395,4,Helpful in time of loss,"This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss."
396,5,Excellent for explaining death to children.,"Excellent picture book that explains the lifetimes of animals, plants, and people. It talks about the usual lifetime, but also explains that some lifetimes are shorter due to certain curcumstances. Esp. good resource to share in the circumstance of a younger person's death."
397,5,wonderful book,This book was of a great help explaining the death of our children's papa. All creatures/things have a life cycle. The illustrations were beautiful. Easily explainable to children.
398,5,Very informative,Well written has a lot of tips and information on the how to fish in ponds and lakes with flies
399,4,"Owned these for years, they're great!","I love the look of these, and they've been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I'm stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
400,2,Poor engineering,This series of DVDs offers some fine performances along with a great deal of annoyance. The top menu offers no access points to most of the listed repertory. Tried on several different machines the problem is persistant. At least the price is reasonable if you don't mind fast forwarding through all tracks to get to the later pieces.
401,2,These guys really suck.,"This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
402,3,About the track 2 problems,I went to buy the CD yesterday and was told that it was sent back because one of the songs had a problem with it. So a fixed version should be coming soon.
403,2,So so only,Very basic . More challenging and rewarding exercises not covered . Many routines designed to be done with a partner than alone
404,1,This is fallacious,wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing.
405,4,Worst Night World book,"This is the worst book in the Night World series. Gillian is LJ Smith's worst heroine[Mary Lynette is the best] Gillian is superficial, all she thinks about is being the most popular girl at school and getting David. David is the worst Night World hero[Thierry is the best]. He is stupid[he cheated on the SATs].If you haven't read any of the Night World books, don't start with this one."
406,1,Worst book by LJ!,"Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable."
407,5,Really different....A pleasant change!,"After having seen this in a bookstore, and having seen Michael Stipe's name on the cover, I decided to pickk it up and boy was I surprised: it really is worth picking up.....it's different and very emotional. At times I found myself inspired to write my own (not much luck, though). A full five-star book!"
408,2,There is more to this story ...,"I am the author of an article for ""The Skeptical Inquirer"" about the origins of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about ""The Mothman Prophecies"" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
409,3,X-Files meets Men in Black meets Close Encounters...,"If you've seen the movie, don't expect the book to be anything like it!(Which is not a new concept by far!) Although an interesting read, it's as strange as the Mothman himself, with eveything else supernatural in between! It leaves you asking yourself ""What in the hell just happened?"""
410,1,Little Value,"It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"
411,3,Do Your Homework,"One reviewer of this book berated those who gave it high reviews with the usual ad hominem attacks created by the quasi-literate. Can you take this work at face value? To some degree, yes. Does the ""Mothman"" really exist? I think before you answer that question some homework assignments need to be completed. There's a revolution in the understanding of paranormal events, ufology, cryptozoology, and the like. Amazingly, most of the subject matter I've read on these topics throughout my lifetime CAN be FAR better understood using this POV. I suggest any and all who have interest in these topics start studying: Patrick Harpur's ""Daimonic Reality.."" and George P. Hansen's ""The Trickster and the Paranormal"", both intense as any textbook I encountered in post graduate work, are highly recommended as the first step."
412,3,Where are all the photos????,"There are plenty of other more detailed reviews about the contents of this book. Let me just say it was entertaining and you have to suspend a lot of disbelief. However, what irritated me the most was ""where the heck were all the photos""? Considering the amount of time Mr. Keel spent in West Virginia/Ohio area watching the skies I can not believe he NEVER took any photos. Granted a lot of time he spent watching and sighting was at night but they had film and cameras back in the early 70's that could handle night photography. There is mention of a an individual trying to do a documentary but the cameras would malfunction or the fim would not develop properly but I found this pretty lame. There are not even any photos of the town, landmarks, roads, witnesses or any physical evidence. I found this the most dissappointing of all. Photos would have made this extremely more credible book."
413,3,Good or bad depending on what your looking for,"This book isn't only about Mothman but also UFO, mystery lights, skin burns and such. It's pretty interesting, the retelling of the mysteriuos events, but Keel doesn't sensationize them, which leads to a fairly dry book. You can see why he stands out in his field, he's experienced these things but doesn't over embelish, draw conclusions, or try to start a religion of belief, just says this happened, and this, and that, and so on. So, while I liked the 'hard' facts, it's told in a way that loses interest. Also in the telling, he 'jumps' around a lot, here's one on day 1, here's one on day 20, here's a continuation of day 1 on day 5, etc. It's hard to stay focused on what's happening or what he is trying to do. It's not a bad book, just depends on what you're looking for."
414,1,"Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . . .","It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
415,2,Unidentified Reading Object,"I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, ""ufo"" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."
416,1,ZZZZZZZZZZ.....snooze-fest,"Great, another socially aware electro-dance record. I can't wait for the an Iraqi to come out with one about the current US led invasion."
417,3,It's got a nice beat and I can dance to it...sorta,"After the relentless hype building up to the oft-delayed release of M.I.A.'s debut CD, it's finally here, and...well...it's a bit of a letdown, quite honestly, after all the hoopla. Sure, ""Galang"" ""Sunshowers"" and especially ""$10"" are catchy addictive Timbaland-meets-Basement Jaxx on a boat to Jamaica blender, but after a few spins, song after song begins to sound exactly the same, and MIA's signature ""patois"" grates after a bit, too. Strip away the state-of-the-art production beats & sheen from Richard X and Diplo, and you haven't got much - sorta work in progress. I think M.I.A. has lots of potential, but needs to work on her songwriting skills a bit more if she wants to last longer than her cover stories."
418,1,bloody awful,"sounds like a third world elementary school class on a field trip to a crack factory. if this music is so revolutionary and worldly, how come the only people listening to it are skinny white boys who wear hats with earflaps indoors?"
419,1,Save your money... Don't believe the hype.,"I heard a lot of chatter about this new girl M.I.A. and her album getting a lot of good reviews. I don't know if her phenomenon is a result of her label hyping her in publications or what, but after listening to her album once through, I would advise you to stay away unless ecstasy-rave music is your thing. She is nearly unintelligible on all of her vocals and is drowned out by the incessant reverb present on all most all of her tracks. This is the definition of drivel. I am happy for her and her interesting life story, but her music does not interest me. Save your $!"
420,1,terrible... absolutely terrible,"This is quite possibly the absolute worst thing I've ever heard in my entire life. If you're considering buying this CD ,I suggest you go outside, find a construction site, walk up to the guy with the jackhammer, and press your ear to the side of it. If you like how that sounds, then go buy the CD. If not, well.... ""Galang,"" the reggaeton hit, isn't even something to wave a steamy pile of you-know-what at... and the music just goes downhill from there. ""bucky done gun"" (which doesn't even make any sense as a title) is good for use as a humorous conversation starter, but that just about exhausts its usefulness or likeability... much the same as the rest of the CD."
421,1,WTF????????,"This album is able to be previewed in full on NME.com If I were you I would go there to find out just what you're about to endure. This album sucks extremely bad. I have not heard anything this half assed in all but two weeks. This garbage getting good reviews is only an indication of the white reviewers out there trying to make this seem cooler than it isn'nt. The beats are exactly the same on every track. Handclaps and half rhythms are only one tenth of the awkwardness on this record. I dont think that anyone with fully functioning ears would like this record, unless they think it makes them look different. For the most part, there is nothing innovative on this record. This is what bad pop music will sound like in ten years. MIA has recorded a travesty ahead of her time. Once again, go to NME.com and preview this before you actully waste your money on this. The sound of this record could have been reproduced with a kettle drum and sticks banging together in a long hall."
422,4,Incomparable,"Say what you will about Arular, M.I.A.'s singularly funky debut album, but one thing you most definitely cannot say is that it's trite, unoriginal cookie-cutter mainstream. You gotta give her props on making a truly original, heartfelt, fun, and invigorating piece of art. Songs like Hombre (w/ Spanish), Bucky Down Gun (w/ Sri Lankan and English slang) are impossible to categorize ...and sometimes hard to understand...but incredibly fun and original, nonetheless. Pull Up the People and Bingo are my fav tracks as they combine M.I.A.'s sultry voice with pulse-pounding beats. Bottom line, if you have an open mind and want something new that's invigorating, singular, and sexy, then this is it."
423,3,The Art of the Pretentious Novel,"I've read this book twice, but I admit I've not yet read any of Milan Kundera's other work. Maybe they're amazing. Maybe. But judging from this book--and from some of the other reviewers who have posted here--I'd guess they're about as unpretentious as a pale, young intellecutal discussing the merits of W.G. Sebald and Friedrich Nietsche at a Cambridge, Massachussetts tea shop.This book DEFINES pretentious. The author knows you're an uneducated fool, and he will prove it to you.That said, he's not an idiot, and a lot of his pompousness is justified. If you don't mind having a thousand things quoted at you that you've only read half of, or the author's overall snobby tone, then you really might find some good insights into a the structure of books and the weaving of stories....Or, you might find yourself scribbling death threats to the author in the margins. ...Yeah, that's a bad habit of mine."
424,3,nice casual set,Saran wrap does not stick to the dishes and it is very inconvenient to store food in fridge. Some of the cups and plates have different shade of color. Brand stamps on the bottom of the dishes are smeared or double-stamped and I do not like that either.Overall they are nice everyday dishes but I do not think they are made with careful quality control.
425,2,Nice but shows scratches.,"I fell in love with these great dishes but I am dissapointed that they need to be replaced within a few years. They were our wedding set and I wish they didn't look awful. We only use them for family meals and use my husband's everyday Johnson Bros. dishes that are 50 years old! They look great. Too Bad the quality isn't like it used to be... unless we just got a ""bad batch"" although they were purchased from different stores where we registered... Nice to set the table with but will scratch unless your family uses plastic tableware. We don't."
426,1,noritake colorwave stoneware,"I was disappointed with the shipping delay of the cooking company. They said they would reimburse the shipping charges but to this date they have not. The product was shipped beyond the date which they said they would ship it, and this was an unusual amount of time."
427,5,Noritake Colorwave Graphite,"I absolutely love this set of dishes. They are dishwasher safe which is a must for me, and microwave safe. The dishes have a nice weight to them, they are not overly heavy or too light. I have been using this set for 8 months now, and I have no complaints at all. I would defiantly recommend this set!"
428,3,"nice, but not what the gift recipient wanted.",It was very nice and arrived quickly. I bought this as a gift but it wasn't what the recipient wanted. I returned it and ordered the one requested.
429,4,In depth study,"This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer."
430,5,"if you need to use a thermometer often, this is the one to get","My wife has some health issues and needs to monitor her temperature regularly. We have gone through all of the cheap digital thermometers we could find, I finally got sick of having the variance in readings(some were off by as much as .5 degrees!) I decided to find the best one I could get. this is it. the same one found in hospitals and doctor's offices, the 690 is accurate, fast and reliable. It also has a history, which makes reporting to your doctor if you need to easy to do. if you only need to take your temp once in a while, don't bother with this, but if you even have to take it weekly, I would say this is the only one to consider. make sure you get extra probe covers and replace the battery regularly but otherwise using the model could not be faster or easier."
431,4,Play cabana,"My husband and I are very happy with our play cabana! We bought it for our 4 month old back in May 2005. We have used it for 2 beach trips. My husband was able to put it together and take it apart easily on the beach (even on windy days). We love the side pockets to put sand bags in to keep it stable on windy days. We just filled plastic bags with sand and placed them in the pockets instead of putting the sand directly into the pockets. With the front being netted and the 2 side ""windows"" being netted she got a great cross breeze. We love that it is SPF 50. We placed her tent under an SPF 50 umbrella for extra sun protection and shade. We love it!!"
432,1,NOT a review of the music -- just Amazon,iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well.
433,5,Seiltanzertraum,"As a fan of the German language, I enjoied this CD because it provided a chance to improve language skills while also listening to great music, with a nice, upbeat tempo, and the lyrics do make you think. The songs are of relavant topics, and really do hit home. I loved the CD, and I hope Pur becomes more popular in the States, their music is great."
434,4,Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011),"Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website."
435,2,Too much self absorption,The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind.
436,3,Beautifully written.,"Kincaid shows that she's a talented author. THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MY MOTHER is beautifully written. It's not about her mother at all, but about the search for knowledge about this woman that she never met. And thereby a search into herself (well, into the character's self). It's quiet. She even describes ugliness quietly. ""I long to meet the thing greater than I am, the thing to which I can submit."" I was able to sink into it as I read it, but the book didn't stay with me after I was done."
437,2,This is a fuzzy description of SNMP,"I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain."
438,4,Great Book for Young and Old,"This saint is my patron, so I could not resist reading her story. This book was well written and kept my interest, as it would for a teenage, or even a younger person. The author did a great job telling the story of this American Saint."
439,5,like the critics say: RIVETING!,the book was great. i can't wait for the next one. definitely captivating.
440,3,Great plot but poorly written,"I really liked the idea of a modernday Frankenstein book. The plot is very cool and revolves around a number of very interesting characters. But the problem is there are like 92 chapters in this book. That makes each chapter about six pages long. In six pages you can't really be absorbed into the story. Just when something begins to happen that is exciting...BAM you're chapter is over and you are reading about another character. Sometiems chapters even split a single scene into two parts.Bottom line is that the book is good...but I just couldn't really get into it. (But I will be reading book 2, hopefully it will flow a bit better than this one)"
441,3,Another Koontz sucess,"I enjoyed this book and do not think I need to reiterate what the other folks have said in their reviews. I do not think it is as good as some of his others, but nevertheless a good story. I think the series should have been done in one book. This was another ""large print with lots of spaces"" book and I alwys feel a bit cheated when I get one.My complaint with this book is that nowhere is Kevin Anderson's name mentioned by either the author or the publisher. I did not even realize until halfway through the book that he was involved. All I can say is ""Dean, you have enough kudos to share a little with your co-author""."
442,2,Dean Koontz's Frankenstein,"I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it."
443,5,1st in the Frankenstein series,Read this when it first came out but didn't have the Kindle edition. Wanted to read again so purchased it. I totally enjoyed reading it again.
444,5,Koontz at his best,"Dean Koontz' three-part take on the Frankestein story is some of the best work he has ever written, very fast paced and addictive this book is impossible to put down. I read the last 250 pages of it in one sitting it was that good.Highly reccomended."
445,2,Frankenstein Prodigal Son,"I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this book. The character Decaulion was boring. I didn't think much of the ending (I don't want to give it away). Usually I'm surprised by the ending, or satisfied. A predictable conclusion."
446,5,Loved it!!!,I bought this book because it was one of the few I hadn't read of Koontz yet. I didn't know what to expect because the Frankenstein idea has become almost a cliche. I was pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put the book down. I immediatelly went out and bought book 2. Now I'm waiting for the third to be written. I strongly recommend this book for any Koontz fan.
447,4,Best In Series,"I have read all the books in this series, and like so many other series (whether book or movie) the first (this one) is definitely the best. This story is very riveting and won't disappoint you. You will want to read the rest of the series, and will be glad you did; but in the end you'll realize that each book after this one gets more unbelievable to the point that the last one is pure fantasy or science fiction."
448,2,Zr40 Cannon,"The camcorder was little dirty, and had a missing lens cover...Joanne did not have the missing cover and did not know why it was dirty...The power cord was defective...ordered a new one...Looked like it was chewed into...The case (cassette) compartment was slightly bent and unable to open at first...made some adjustments to it...Fred"
449,2,Sent mine back the next day,"I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun was quickly over. Low light recording (in my apartment with lights on) was horrible and even with low-light mode selected, it was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better. I would seriously hold out for a better camera, even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike."
450,5,R.I.P. Granpappy Mafioso,"Mannnn this boy be wreckin, Big Steve from the Woss Ness, RIP man, why do all the good rappers gotta die man, and all the crappy ones still around puttin out wack albums. Get this fa sho, if you from h-town, u already know, and if u dont, u a busta!"
451,5,Looks nice.,I love that it sits INSIDE the window casing so my dog can't get to it as easily & it looks really nice.
452,4,Different sort of time travel,Enjoyed this book even though it was time travel with mystical creatures. The story was interesting and I enjoyed the history along with the folklore.
453,1,Nirvana Sliver Best Of The Box,"As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect."
454,3,Only for fans,"I liked as a fan, but only to point out who really is a fan. This album contains some tracks from the box with the lights out."
455,2,Milk It: Some Of The Box,"Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
456,1,Horrible Quality,"Even though the song list looks impressive, don't waste your money on this one. This is the poorest quality sound I've ever heard on a CD.Being a Nirvana Fan, I have other albums that sound great, but I can't recommend this one.Again don't waste your money."
457,1,Very Low Quality Recordings,Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere.
458,1,Kurdt Blushing in Heaven,"Wow, what a suprise! Almost all the worst songs from the box are right here on one CD! In addition to all the smash hits on the CD are three previously unreleased tunes soon to shoot up six notches to number one on Kasey's Top Forty this Sunday. A comparative failure to the upcoming Ozzfest 10-Year anniversary DVD. One star for Blandest."
459,1,Stupid,"I must admit, it was terrible. I hate to admit i liked it. I guess it was so STUPID, you couldn't help it."
460,2,Too broad and too liitle info,"Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more."
461,4,Is it really crystal?,"I just got this yesterday. I have crystal glassware, and the easy way for me to see if something is crystal or not is by simply tapping the glass.Well, when I tapped them, it sure didn't sound like crystal, rather it sounded exactly like glass. And I can't find the word ""crystal"" on the box anywhere. I was rather disappointed, but then again, what do you expect..."
462,2,Marginal,"This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW."
463,1,"IT IS DESEPTIVE ,","IT IS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WASIT DOSE FIT THE CAMRA BUT I THOUGHT THAT IT HAD A USB END ALSO , SO THAT I COULD HOOK TO MY COMPUTER"
464,2,Cable is a cable is a cable,Buying a Sony cable wasn't worth it. I could have spent less buying any 4pin to 4pin 1394 firewire cable. Search around. Buying name brand may not be worth it.
465,2,Sony I. Link 4Pin Digital Video Cable,I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors. I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality. It was advertised as new. When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work. On examining it I found that it had a bent pin. When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder. What a bummer. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection. I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons.
466,4,Cabled seemed to work properly,I was trying to resolve a technical issue with a TRV-950 Sony Handy Cam but the cable I received seemed to work between cameras but didn't solve the issue with capturing to Sony Vegas Pro 8. There is something I can't figure out with the 950 so I have been using my TRV-900 and Ulead to capture video then importing that into Vegas for editing. If someone reads this and knows how to get a TRV-950 to capture to Vegas Pro 8 directly please let me know.
467,5,Must read for all Chrisitans,This books explains in simple language God's gifts to us and His amazing love. An easy read with huge concepts.May it be a blessing to you as well.
468,3,Funny but avoid R-rating,"I bought an R-rated copy and didnt think there was going be a difference. Well, the gore is cut out of this picture. There is little here and there, but the unrated version is so much better. Its an alight movie without the gore, one of the funniest pictures ive seen in a long time."
469,5,Movies I Own U Should 2!!!!!!!!!!!,"Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!"
470,3,Satisfaction,This movie was bought for my husband and he said that it was interesting. He had heard of the movie and wanted to view it for himself.
471,1,Not one change,"I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since."
472,5,"Ah, Waechtersbach","I bought these to compliment my basic cherry red 4 piece set. Although it came with cereal bowls, I wanted something casual to serve pasta or stew but did not want the huge pasta bowls. These are the perfect size and the color is a perfect match."
473,1,Didn't like...,"I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
474,2,"Two Divas,that should shut up!","Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!"
475,5,Worth it,I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem
476,2,Impressive character development but mostly morbid.,"""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."
477,1,"Wrong title, right author",I selected the complete short stories of Malamud and this book is only a selction of short stories. I was disappointed but we decided to keep it and be more careful in ordering.
478,3,Very basic Ju-Jitsu...,"The Small-circle of Wally Jay is a very basic book about Ju-Jitsu. As a Ju Jitsu sensei myself, I want to catalogue this book as a program for 6 to 3rd Kyu (white -yellow and orange belt)."
479,2,A few good tracks,There is only 2-3 great trackes on this. Such a shame that most of these compilations only ever have a few great inspiring tracks while the rest are just pure background stuff.
480,4,Two Families Shaped by History,"I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the ""telenovela"" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots."
481,5,One of my favorites,I wish I had more time to write a review worthy of this book! I will say that this book is fulfilling and rich read. The stories of the women and their families in this book provide insight into the contrast of the social classes in El Salvador in times past. The very personal stories allow the reader to connect with the characters while learning a great deal about the history of El Salvador from the 1930's on.
482,3,Good movie but bad quality,I rented this movie on Amazon Instant Video. I've seen the movie before and was watching it to satisfy a Bollywood craving.The movie itself is about a family with three sons and a daughter. The first two hours are really happy and full of songs and dancing. The last hour is the family drama hour.Giving this three stars because the quality of the video is pretty bad. The image was not clear and the audio sounded a little muffled at times.There were no subtitles for most of the songs.
483,5,Dark stories,"Ambrose Bierce's collected stories, mostly of the Civil War but also of peacetime America in the last half of the 19th Century, are amazing not least because of the fact that he was one of the first to write in this genre. No doubt much of his inspiration for his Civil War stories were based upon his own observations as an officer in the Union Army while other stories may have been ones he came up with while living on the Pacific coast.Ghostly occurances, strange machines, unexplained episodes, monsters... Bierce seems to have lived in a strange world of shadows all his own. It is somehow fitting that Bierce simply disappeared in the early 20th Century.Great book. Definitely a classic."
484,4,Good early biography for youth,"This little paperback (31 pages) was published in 1993, just before Chavez passed away at the age of 66. It is probably considered out of date.But it has some great photographs of Chavez all through his life. It has a short, concise biography.What did I learn? Chavez's grandfather immigrated from Mexico and fathered 14 children. Cesar's father was the last one to leave the family home and married rather late, at the age of 38.Cesar did not like school, nor did he like the English language.He fasted three times for over three weeks each. This must have been tough and may have indelibly harmed his health.So, this book of course was published before Chavez's birthday became a state holiday in California. And we hardly hear anything anymore about the United Farm Workers. That's an area for some young person to follow up. Diximus."
485,1,Plain Putrid,"This book is so obscene in some parts, and its not even written by Naomi Campbell, but some filthy man. Dont pick up this book if you want your brain to be burnt away by the promiscious literary flop of some freak."
486,5,book: Tess of the D'Urbervilles,"Timeless story of a woman and her struggle to care for those she loved. Fighting against the male dominated society of her time, Tess sacrifices her own interests to provide for her family and attempt to stay true to the man she loves. Hardy does a wonderful job of painting the landscape and using it to enhance Tess's physical struggles. His portrait of Tess as a strong woman is balanced with her vulnerability, pure heart and hope for a better future.Norton's version includes insight into Hardy's background and the writing of Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Very helpful towards understanding the dynamics of the story."
487,5,"well pooh pooh, this book is good.","There is many ways to look at this book and how it corolates to his Hardy's life but the point is I think he wanted to make this a beautiful work of art. And it is. Many girls who went through tough times in life can relate to this like I have. It might not be dramatic as this book but I have been in many situations that were unbelievable and ""soap opera - ish"" and I have seen all sorts of people and I do not misjudge people because everyone at one point in their lives do things out to character. This book is good and I can't say well written but it is a good piece of art."
488,2,An unfortunately boring book,"I'm a fan of classics, but I could not force myself to struggle through this book. I could neither identify with the characters (Tess especially seemed extraordinarily weak-willed and passive) nor follow through the endless description of the novel. Iw ould suggest a different book"
489,4,A Classic Theme In Life,"I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time."
490,2,Do not read this book!,"I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped."
491,2,Boring,"I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person."
492,1,Boring!,"We had to read it for our GCSE coursework. Everybody found it boring and too descriptive. If you have a choice, do not choose this book! To make it worse, it is incredibly long and depressing. DO NOT EVEN TOUCH IT!!!"
493,3,"Great book, lousy format.","I love the book but the size is very unwieldy. It is the size of a coloring book, very heavy. The print is small and difficult to read. Of course the book itself is a wonderful classic if you love Thomas Hardy like I do."
494,1,THIS BOOK BLOWS,"I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day."
495,3,Tess is a pritty good book,"i Do like this book. I red it for school for 10th grade. But it was pritty hard for me to read, because Im not a English person. I admit that I used cliff's notes alot, but i did reed some. I agree with the person that wrote you should see Titantic before reading this book. Titanic is the pick for intelagent people, and you don't have to think much!! But I do like 'Tess.' It's a very sad book, but I do not like Angel Clare. I think he's a wimp--Why can't he be like Jack Dawson and save Tess (Rose)? Tess of the Dubervilles is a very tough, but good book."
496,2,Amazon Affiliate,"I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress."
497,4,Good read,Reading it for the second time. Read it for the first time in high school. This is a good read and a good story.
498,5,This is one of the best toys we have!,"Hi, Today we went to toysrus and picked up this puppy surprise. And we LOVE it!When we opend it up every one was excited to see how many puppys it would have. (including Mom!) And we got 2 girls and 1 boy :) Of all the reviews I read everybody said they got 3 or 4 puppys, I never herd of someone getting 2. Well Im going to go play with my puppys, bye :)- Jackie"
499,1,Swagman XC-2 Bike Rack,I bought this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The rubber tubs are sticky and you need to wear gloves and it leaves marks on your bikes. The red rubber protecter fell off the first time it was used. The lock that was recommedned to go with it does not fit. When the tubes are locked in place you need a hammer to get them to release. The tire holder rails will not lock in place even with a pliers. I used the product as instructed in the manual and my bike fell off in the middle of an intersection! If you use this product than you need to bungi your bike in three places to secure it! Do Not just use the hooks!
500,4,Bike rack,"Works as advertised. Arrived promptly. Is pretty heavy and more difficult to assemble and install than anticipated, but overall the best product I have seen for mounting 4 bikes with curved top tubes onto the back of a hitch. The manufacturer should increase the spacing between the center 2 bikes. I may have a welder do this modification. Drove 6 hours carrying 2 bikes and they didn't budge and were not scratched up by the travel."
501,5,Dance album of the year!,"Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric"
502,5,The next best thing to being in class with Naader,Naader has taken his class directly to video - this is a wonderful opportunity to experience his caring and warm direction for beginning to intermediate students of hatha yoga. The next best thing to being there.
503,3,Useful but wasteful!,"I was looking for smaller width collars/nipples so you could actually USE the ""ready to feed"" bottles as they were intended, and actually found these disposable nipples second. I discovered that the spare bottle parts for my 'pump and feed' Medela bottles are actually the exact same size as these nipples!!!!! So to save the Planet some more trash, look in Amazon.com for ""MEDELA SPARE BOTTLE PARTS"". The kit you find has three nipples/collars/caps per $11 box. They work perfect and are reusable over the long term! Check it out!!!! If you need them for travel, a water rinse and a good wipe down with a pacifier wipe will work great in a pinch if you cant get to a kitchen/microwave before you run out.

504,2,Logitech Wilife outdoor dead camera repair C26 C27 C31 C32,"The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting).[...]They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C.

505,4,Outdated but insightful,"The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there. Regardless, a fun read which doesn't follow the stereotypical 'Japanese kids don't have fun' or 'Japanese people don't have individuality'."
506,1,Pretentious,"""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone."
507,3,Unbearably long...,There is no reason for this movie to be as long as it is. The length dilutes endlessly dilutes the story.At 2 hours it would have been a fine movie.
508,2,The unbearable lightness of being,"This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere."
509,3,Interesting but not much more than that,"Most of the time Phil Kaufman and me get along pretty good, and this time is no different. However, I really didn't get as involved in this one as I did The Wanderers, The Right Stuff, or Quills. Some provacative camera work a plus, though overall I thought it could have been better."
510,3,avid book reader and movie buff,"read the book. trust me read the book. ( unless all want to see are the naked in this movie) just go get the book, beats the movie by 10 stars"
511,2,Read the book - it takes less time!,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film."
512,5,A correction to the previous reviewer's ethics!,"I have reviewed this book previously but am having a second bite because I am annoyed by the conduct of the previous reviewer. He claims, apparently trying to dam the dialogue, there is a phrase: ""As you known, Raargh Sergeant, we Wunderkzin ..."" No such phrase occurs in the book. A human says to a Kzin born on Wunderland ""We sometimes call you Wunderkzin ..."" I suggest that if the reviewer wishes to pick holes in the style of a particular story he quote the actual words he complains of and not something he has invented. I believe this is related to a thing called ethics, you know, like honesty and truthfulness.And all thes stories in the book are teriffic! Scream and Leap!"
513,1,Disappointment,The drive lasted 3 days before the flash fell off and was lost from the encasement. The encasement was examined and appeared to be flimsy plastic. I don't recommend this product based on a lost unit.
514,4,The wife loves it.,"Only a slight hitch because it didnt quite fit in a Levitron opening. But, with a bit of filing, we cured that.Now she can set the knob and leave the bathroom. Saves a/c costs of forgetting the fan is running. A fine solution to an unmentionable problem."
515,1,Completement nul,"Fait sur commande et ennuyant a mourir, cette album est tout a fait parfait pour s'endormir...nul!"
516,1,Horrible,"This book is terrible. The writing is terrible, the art is terrible (obviously terrible, too: one of the dragons' heads was obviously photoshopped onto another dragon's body on another page), the story is boring, it's just... bad. It's anti climatic, and throughout the story it's just hardship after hardship of them attempting to kill dragons. I found it hard to finish just skimming it."
517,3,Not OE sound quality.,"I've purchased many aftermarket mufflers claiming OE type construction and sound quality, none of them have lived up to their claims. The last muffler of this type I bought leaked from every seam and got loose baffles in only a few months. If you actually want OE sound quality, especially on a truck, then get an OE muffler, even though it will be expensive. I'm hoping this will at least last longer than the last one did. This one claims to be stainless steel, but doesn't really look like it."
518,2,Manhattan Transfer can't sing!,"I can't understand how Manhattan Transfer gets all those studio musicians to play on their albums. I mean, it just makes their singing sound worse against the best drumming (Steve Gadd), bass playing and sax playing in the world. The two stars are for Kafka and the studio musicians only."
519,2,Snowbore,"Don't get me wrong, this is a totally enjoyable listen, but is it just me or is every single song on the disc the same. Hell, they're even the same as on Cold & Bouncy, Hawaii and Gideon Gaye. The one thing that makes this album different is John McEntire's wonderful production and the 'Lab girls. If you dont own any High Llamas disc, start here... but if you already do, dont expect anything new."
520,5,I don't know why I love this stuff but I do!,"My favorite track is the first one, ""Bach Ze"". ""Harpers Romo"" sounds like it should have been on the Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"" album, ""Triads"" reminds me so much of ""Hawaii"", and ""Go To Montecito"" sounds decidely like a Steely Dan tune. Laetitia and Mary are nice additions ..."
521,4,"Interesting book, a little more detail would be nice.","This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."
522,3,dvd,"wish that he would show more in the field and less in the classroom,,and stay with the book, which is top level in my book...james.........."
523,5,Lost Cities of North & Central America,"I loved the book. From the places I have been and the books I have read, this book hits the mark. We need more like it.Good Job!"
524,5,"Something every 20 year old can relate to, at least","One of the most often used metaphors for inner growth is the travel journal and I'm sure Kerouac would have enjoyed Gurdjieff's somewhat autobiograhical travel novel ""Meetings with Remarkable Men."" Has this generation (2007) not yet found it's Dharma Bums? Maybe the line between literature and music is blurring (thanks to Dylan, Bob that is). Where is the excitement of adventure that leaps off the pages of these books stirring an energy to do something now, to seek, to find, to discover!!I would have every 14-20 year-old in America read Dharma Bums (and Electric Kool Aid Acid Test)... it's up to YOU to put some adventure in YOUR LIFE... IT'S YOUR LIFE!"
525,5,The Dharma Bums,"The Dharma Bums has the Jack Kerouac style that On the road carried, but is faster paced than the authors most famous work. The themes are drastically different also, On the Road being a sensualist's dream, and Dharma Bums being the down to earth maturity that came from years of living on the road. Nature is a key factor in the book, its no Walden but the way Kerouac intertwines nature, Buddhism and the American dream is a very entertaining read. I would recommend this book over On the Road simply because it is shorter and blends a variety of things that are uncommonly seen together. The only difficulty was having to look up a few terms in regard to the eastern religions, but even that doesn't detract from the flow of the book. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked On the Road, and if you haven't read any Kerouac, this is a good place to start."
526,2,Buddihism book for introspective thought,"This is Jack jumping into the Budda scene. Good if you feel like you need a Zen fix, and his observations on how to aspire to happiness are actually quite good too."
527,1,Not As It Would Seem,Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status.
528,3,Good history,"Kerouac's most interesting work especially if you're interested in the beginnings of American Buddhism. Chronicles a time where the author and Gary Synder traveled together. Not great literature, but interesting from a historical perspective."
529,2,"I'm gonna get blasted for this, but...","... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
530,1,The Kindle version costs more than the paperback,"As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!"
531,4,Tresure Found,"As bad as it may sound I had not heard of Jack Kerouac until very recently. In my defense he died a year before I was born and although I have always been a reader it took until now for my reading interests to expand and give me this opportunity. I am enjoying Dharma Bums a lot as it speaks of things that are just as important today as they were when it was written like living a simple life is more free than living a consumer driven one. I have even started looking into Jack to know more on who he was and those he references in the book (look online to find who the real people are compared to the character names; one being Poet , author Gary Snyder). I also plan on buying the book ""on the Road"" scroll version which is the recomended version."
532,2,Flat Kerouac,"I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written."
533,4,Good read,Great read. If you have something mote profound to read I would suggest that. All in all a great story though.
534,1,Dont waste your time,"Uninteresting and boring, the story accomplishes nothing from start to finish. Save your time and money and dont bother with this book."
535,5,Don't Hesitate to buy these!,"I am so fussy about my sheets that I spend a mint on sheets, so I was a little nervous about buying 19.99 sheets from amazon sight unseen. These are wonderful. They do not ball up and are as soft as can be. They are the kinda sheets when you run your legs back and forth they are cool and soft. I am going back for more at these prices for the rest of my beds in the house."
536,1,Absolute trash.,"I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed."
537,2,Dark Moon,"Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad."
538,1,that kid wit wickie yell like a woman all movie like he was pms ruin the movie.,the movie was bad the kid ruined it yellign and being angry the whole time. And it was the same as the last 2 movies nothing out very boring ending was ok.
539,5,transformers,have always been a lover of the transformers ever since the childhood days. followed it from the very first movie that was created. great sound effects along with visual. went to see all of them at the theatre & then decided that I wish to own. even became a fan of the soundtrack. non stop action.
540,1,Transformers,I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting
541,2,Avoid if you want ANY extra features.,"First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time."
542,2,Starts of with a bang but fades,"I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie."
543,1,This ... movie ... sucks,"At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said."
544,5,3D was made for Transformers,Dark of the Moon 3D is great! This is why I purchased a 3D TV for action films that make you feel like you are part of the action....
545,3,Too Much Action - Yet Boring,"I bought this with much anticipation of liking this movie a lot. Sadly, it was a disappointment. Although there was a lot of action and great special effects, the transformers were too corny and eventually very boring."
546,1,A Time Waster,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor Shia has to have a high paid model to make his acting look better.
547,3,Not what I hoped for,"I loved the movie, but the quality of the DVD is bad, bad, bad. When it starts I always have to turn off the subtitles. Why? The picture is fuzzy, but generally ok. That's what I get for looking for a discount."
548,4,LOVEEED IT! LOVEEDDD ROSIE <3,"I loved loved this movie! I mean wow! But For some reason everyone say's Rosie is a terrible actress, Personally myself I loved her in this not only because she was smoking (I'm a straight girl btw) but because I just loved the personality that she brought to the screen she made it sexy and just empowered. I loved, the CGI, all the effects are beyond amazing. I like that they used flashbacks of president Kennedy that was really awesome. I would recomend this if you have the time cuddle up and watch this. When I was watching it, time flew by it truly just caught me in, A little towards the end maybe 45 mins or so I got a little distracted with other things it started to just get a little predictable, But overall This movie was amazing :) I'd def. watch it again not only for Rosie but for the amazing actors. I wish there was more Josh Dunhamel in this :( He's down right hot lol:)"
549,1,Hmmmmm.,"I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay."
550,3,"Falls short (blu ray, not the movie).","Nice movie. Much better than Revenge of the Fallen. Much better script with some nice historical twists. Better acting in general including the new girl. As for the blue-ray version of this movie it falls really short of what a blue-ray release should be and what customers are already used to. No extra disc with background information such as interviews, featurettes, deleted scenes, commentaries, bloopers, etc. No Digital Copy disc which is not necessarily a big deal but downloading a 2.24GB file is a bit too much for those of us with data caps from our internet providers (40GB in my case). Seems like a marketing strategy for a future trilogy release (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Bourne, Lord of The Rings, etc) which it is not fair to customers. In all a nice movie with better story and acting but an incomplete blue-ray release."
551,2,Really boring and very flat 3D,I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue
552,3,Finally over...,"Loved the first two films & was very happy with the 2-disc DVDs. This film however in my opinion & I'm sure there will be a lot of dissension was over done, over long & under featured on the blu-ray/dvd combo pack. I am seriously glad I did not see this in the theater in 3d because it must have been totally overwhelming. I could not wait for it to end. Sorry but sometimes less is a lot more. Except where features are concerned. Total lack is very disappointing but I won't be repurchasing another copy."
553,2,simply stupid,"A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie."
554,3,Fun watch but a little disapointing,I loved the other transformers movies and still had fun watching this one. It just wasn't as great as I had hoped. Another thing I didn't like is that the show drops the F*** bomb. GP13 with the F word?! I don't get that.
555,2,"The graphics were good, that's about it.","I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies. This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars. The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base. After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it. I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable."
556,5,transformers,Totally loved the movie. We have all ready watched it twice. Would recommend it to anyone. Can`t wait until another Transformers is made.
557,2,Science Fiction Pushed To The Limit!,"I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real."
558,4,What is the Region of this Bluray?,"HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn't say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says... Multiregion."
559,2,Not worth the 3 month wait,3D is all about pop outs gimmicks which is all missing here there is depth but average not that great. The movie & audio both are great but everybody was anticipating one of the best 3d blurays which is not the case. There are many other movies like Resident evil Final destination 4 & 5 and many others which have awesome 3d effects. If you have already bought the 2d version do not regret.
560,2,"Same as all the others, dull.","Same as all the other recent transformers movies, dull and bland, completely emotionless. The story lacks excitement, and only the occasionally good special effects made me sit through it."
561,1,Digital Copy Code Expired 9/30/12,"I bought this during a Black Friday sale; the digital copy was significant part of my purchasing decision. Inexcusably, the digital copy code expired before this product was sold. At a minimum, this should have been disclosed in the product description."
562,4,Format Error: DTS Surround Sound NOT on Disc,"FYI: As of November 28th 2012, the Product Details for ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) (2011)"" contains the wrong Format - this Blu-ray disc does NOT have DTS Surround Sound. You can see for yourself when you zoom in on the back cover photo. I've already submitted an ""Update Product Info"" request, and will keep the movie because I bought it on a great Black Friday promotion, but I just wanted to let others know in case it influences their purchase."
563,2,"New Product, no bonuses","No special features at all, on either disc, just the movie. Not at all what I expected from a Blu Ray/DVD combo pack."
564,3,Dragged at some points,"My family & I are avid Transformers fans, however this movie wasn't as good as the previous movies. I purchased simply to have in our movie line up."
565,4,Review,"Product was as described and advertise arrive on time or within the promise arrival time , totally satisfied with my purchase , Price was good"
566,2,"Rent for the kids, but DON'T buy it.","Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache."
567,2,Definitely not a recommanded to buy:,"This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features."
568,3,"Much, much better than the second movie, but still flawed...","In short, if you are looking for a high-action movie with fantastic special effects featuring giant robots pummeling and shooting one another, you can't do much better than this. The story is spotty, the characters exagerated, and everything is completely unrealistic, but that's not what you're watching this movie for, right? It's a decent action movie, but it isn't great."
569,5,Super Movie!,I really enjoyed this movie. It had alot of action and kept me entertained through out. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action movies!
570,2,Great Visuals / Terrible Script,"Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. Good effects, terrible plot.It was such a departure from the first two. I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets."
571,2,One bad movie,Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.
572,1,Really Really Bad!,"This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!"
573,2,Too Chaotic,"Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only."
574,2,More of the same bad script writing,They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.
575,1,"Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot","I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies."
576,2,"Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut","I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
577,2,it works....i guess,"This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea."
578,3,Lg Safety Pins,"The safety pins were adequate, but they weren't as sturdy as I would have liked. The size was just right."
579,1,Just a wanna be Rambo,"If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it."
580,3,"""THE MARINE"" ISN'T THAT GREAT","I'M NOT A JOHN CENA FAN! HE'S SUCKS AS A WRESTLER/A RAPPER/AND AS AN ACTOR! AT LEAST DWAYNE ""THE ROCK"" JOHNSON HAS PROVEN HIMSELF (IN SOME MOVIES) THAT HE CAN ACT BUT CENA HASN'T! THE OLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS MOVIE ARE THE ACTION SEQUENCES,BUT BAD ACTING ON ALL THE ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE INCLUDING ROBERT PATRICK WHO PLAYED THE BAD GUY,HE ACTED BETTER IN ""TERMINATOR 2:JUDGEMENT DAY"" AND AS AGENT JOHN DOGGETT IN ""THE X-FILES"" SERIES!"
581,1,MAKES THE RAMBO SEQUELS SEEM LIKE CITIZEN KANE!,"I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!"
582,1,Not satisfied with this item!,"We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again."
583,5,Lorna Doone,I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it
584,4,NOW SUPPORTS ALL WINDOWS PLATFORMS,"eMarker has updated the drivers on their site. The product is now able to support Windows 95, 98, Me and 2000. I bought several as stocking stuffers for Christmas."
585,2,Perfect Idea but just not ready,"The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product."
586,1,Not so hot...,"I thought this product would be great, and help out my kids a lot!! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing. We can't find a lot of just regular songs. It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself."
587,2,Great idea...bad support,I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.
588,3,It's OK,"The idea behind this product is a great one, but the back up for the product is lacking quality. One of the greatest downfall of the product, is the inability to set which Radio Station you where listening to at the moment. I listen to about five different radio stations on my way to work, changing the stations constantly. It wouldn't be so bad looking through the list of what songs where playing on my preset stations if flash wasn't used. I think the use of flash is a bit of overkill. It kills the functionality of the device. Having to wait for its data to load. I think a simple page with great graphics and no animation would have been much better. If you got 20 bucks to burn, and want a cool gadget that grabs attention, get it. If you seriously want to use this often, with more than one radio station, I personally wouldn't get it. It's great though if you only listen to a couple of radio stations."
589,4,This thing is cool!!,"Ignore all those bad reviews if you have some knowledge of the internet and computers. Yes, you do need to have patience to set it up. However once I got everything downloaded, I was in business. It is the coolest toy I ever got for [the price]. Maybe the reason I haven't had any problems with it is because I live in the NY Metro area. Do the marks sometimes take twice? Yeah, so you delete them. I have had none of the problems listed in the other reviews, mine works perfectly...and all my frieds cannot wait to get one too!"
590,4,Scary Storys to tell in the dark,"Scary Story Series4 star ratingThe scary story series by Alvin Schwartz are extreme books that keep you on the edge of your seat. Each book from the series contain many spooky tales that will make you shiver. One of the books from the series is called, ""Scary Story's to tell in the dark."" If you enjoy being frightened or anxious, you should read this book, but if you get scared easily, you may not want to read it. Many of the stories in this book include the dead, blood, noises, and other scary things that may frighten kids under five or sensitive people who get scared greatly. So mainly, you just have to choose to read it based on who you are as a person. If you do like these type of stories, this book is good for halloween parties, camping, sleep-overs, or just for fun when you feel like reading. I really enjoyed this book, you will to."
591,1,Not the original illustrations!,"Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
592,2,Be Cautious with Young Children,"This may be an awesome book for children who are not too sensitve and love to be scared. However, for the more senitive child, it can be very disturbing. A teacher read some of the stories to my 4th grader's class months ago and he is still having trouble sleeping. The pictures are what has bothered him the most. He can't seem to get them off his mind. So, be selective about with whom you share this book. You may have some unhappy parents if you choose to read it to a group."
593,5,"Scary, Freaky, and just plain good reading.","I first read Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark at age 7, (I'm 17 now) after stumbling upon it in my cousin's closet. I couldn't sleep after reading it, (complements of Stephen Gammell's illustrations) and immediatly bought the whole series.My favorite story out of the whole series is ""Harold"" in Scary Stories 3; I won't ruin the story for you, lets just say you'll never look at a scarecrow the same way again.Also, the notes in the back of the books on the origin of the stories is often as interesting as the stories themselves, as you often get some slight variations.My advice to any horror fan would be to buy this series, no matter your age, I think you'll enjoy them."
594,1,new art is garbage,"This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away. I dont have my old copies any more and now the old books are going for outrageous sums. I wanted to get these books for my kids someday--not any more."
595,1,Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!,"I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?"
596,1,Another person who can't believe they changed the art.,"Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."
597,1,Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations,"I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them."
598,3,"Words are still fantastic, but why change the illustrations?","I used to love these books as a child, they were creepy and surreal and most of that was due to the illustrations by Stephen Gammell. I can picture some of the drawings and they are STILL creepy. WHY mess with perfection? It was a perfect one-two punch of story and picture, and now they look pretty generic. Not NEARLY macabre enough. If you can find it, get the original illustrations, they'll skeeve you out properly!"
599,3,Good book for elementary students,"The book that I read Scary Stories to tell in the dark is a good book for kids who still believe in ghost and the others things. If you're going to read it to your brother or sister then it might be an interesting book for you. Just to give you a hint of what kinds of stories it has.One of them is The attic, another is The Viper and there are so many more."
600,3,The Tracks,"Most songs on this collection are the original versions with a couple of remixes included:1. My Prerogative2. Ain'T 2 Proud 2 Beg3. Poison4. She's Got That Vibe5. I'M So Into You (Teddy's Radio Mix)6. Now That We'Ve Found Love7. Rub You The Right Way8. Don'T Walk Away9. Do Me Right10. Sensitivity11. I Like The Way (Kissing Game)12. Is It Good To You13.

Somebody For Me34. Alice, I Want You Just For Me35. Baby Its YouThere it is, the tracks!"
601,5,More fun than UK basketball,"I read ""Water Street'' in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. The characters are warm, the writing is pitch-perfect and the stories flow like Jim Beam. Crystal Wilkinson is Alice Walker on Prozac."
602,2,A disappointment,"Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!"
603,4,Great for the Beginner,"I'm a beginner at bellydancing, and I found this video quite helpful. I wasn't sure about how well it would teach me at first, until I started performing the moves along with the tape- the camera angles are very clear, and each move is demonstrated succinctly. I suggest anyone using this video also stand in front of a mirror while performing the moves to get a clearer understanding of the instructions, or else it can be difficult to know if you are doing the moves correctly. Enough moves are taught to make a very decent dance, although some help with choreography would have been more helpful than just suggesting that the dancer ""improvise"". Even the performace sequences are somewhat helpful, if just to see the variety of costumes. The historical information at the beginning is also a great touch."
604,5,Great Beginner Video,"This is a great introduction to belly dancing! This starter video takes you through many moves for the dance with a peek at veil work, finger cymbals and costuming. Good value for the time and quality of instruction.Unfortunately, you can learn some of these moves incorrectly with this or any tape. If you can, find a local class/instructor. Plus, it's more fun to learn with a whole group of women!!"
605,1,These videos are horrible!,"I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!"
606,4,Excellent video although somewhat dated,"I ordered this video along with two others by Atea. It is a good introduction for beginners, easy and fun to follow along. But it is obviously dated, both in hairstyles (big hair!) and video quality. I hope Atea will make an updated version of this tape.In the event she updates the video, my suggestions for improvement would be:1. Move the history of the dance to the end of the tape, merely because when you are using it as a workout video, it's a pain to have to fast-forward past that portion every time you want to dance.2. More full-body shots so one can see exactly what a dancer is doing with feet, arms, etc., rather than focusing on one part.3. Atea is a good dancer, but she is stilted when speaking in the video and obviously reading cue-cards. I think she should stick to the dancing demonstrations and do a separate voice-over for instructions, or better yet, use someone with a more relaxed and natural voice for instructions."
607,4,Great fitting boot,"This is my second pair, the first are wearing like iron and I wanted to make sure I could replace them."
608,5,Good value for money,Bought this for Michigan winter. Keeps my feet warm and dry. Works fine on icy surfaces as well. Will test its durability now
609,3,Gone hiking.,"I purchased these boots to have a better foot/ankle experience while hiking in the local mountains. They definitely helped my feet and ankles be more comfortable. The one down side has been the top of my toes keep getting rubbed raw while hiking. The first time I hiked in them I thought it was due to breaking in and maybe another pair of socks would help (I had on 1 pair of good hiking socks). So the next time I went out I wore 2 pairs of socks, but the same thing happened. I have now hiked many times (so boots are broken in) and I always have rubbed some toes raw. Not sure why, but I think it maybe there is too much distance between the boot and the top of my foot (I have normal size feet and have never had this happen before). So overall I like the boots, but they don't seem to like Me."
610,4,Snow boots for happy feet.,"I ordered my boots because they sounded great. I am not disappointed,they are great right out of the box.Fit well except the tongue is very short and could fit better around the ankle more. My order was delayed because of the snow but i am happy to finally be wearing them. Thank you very much for selling these fine and affordable boots. P.S I will spread the word to all the people i know who want happy feet. signed Mark Berglund"
611,1,Poor quality control,"I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control."
612,2,These boots are much darker than the picture,"Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected."
613,4,A good boot,This is a great boot. Light with good arch support. I wear them in mud and rain and my feet are dry and warm. Well worth the money.
614,3,Dont last long,"The Boots are great for about two months then break down fast.I think the construction could be alot better,I hope that it can be improved on"
615,2,Right Boot Defective,"The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
616,5,"Look and work great, very good value!","I've had an older pair of these same boots for years, and it was finally time to replace them due to wear. It looked around at various brands for the same type of boots, and ended up back at these Hi-Tec Altitudes again. The appearance and value of these boots is hard to beat. I bought a pair in black and dark chocolate and they're both great boots. The sizing was accurate, and the boots fit perfectly."
617,5,Great shoes/boots,"I buy a new pair of Hi-tec's like these re-occuringly. Waterproof, not bad to look at, pretty comfortable and very long wear. Recommend to got a width wider when ordering (if you're in a climate where in the winter you'd want thick socks)."
618,5,14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE,"My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
619,1,"Don't fall for the ""junk science"" scam","Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
620,2,Buy the 1993 version instead.,"I bought this book thinking it would be an updated and improved version of the 1993 bookArmed and Female: Twelve Million American Women Own Guns, Should You?by the same author. That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere."
621,1,know the source of your information,"While there is some very good information in the book, I ask you to consider the source. Ms. Quigley has testified on behalf of a woman shooting a gun down a hillside toward a strip mall at some dogs that were barking but not approaching her, that she was acting reasonably. The jury disagreed and convicted the defendant she was testifying for of grossly negligent discharge of a firearm. Her approach is a bit aggressive."
622,2,Ryan's Daughter DVD,We were disappointed that this DVD would not play on our regular DVD player. We were able to play it on our computer. There must be something different about the format. Jim Jones
623,3,great classic,"I remember the breathtaking scenery and the exquisite score of Maurice Jarre.... I have it on my coffee table with the intention of watching it this weekend. It was a wonderful movie, slow moving, but the characterizations were well done... This movie will only appeal to a select audience, there is no action, or special effects. A love story with a wonderful cast of characters in beautiful Ireland with a lush musical score.. "" It was the best time, It was the first time, It was a party just to be near you...."" enjoy and feast your eyes...!"
624,2,ryan's daughter,The DVD was fine - it would be useful if you explained about the regions and how you have to change your dvd program to watch the dvd.
625,3,Good camera but LCD screen quit working,I bought this camera when it was new on display at circuit city and it worked great for a while but at some point the LCD quit working. I have had the camcorder close to five years and other than the LCD issue it is a great camcorder.
626,1,Malfunction after short time,The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally .......
627,5,U need this JRB CD!,"This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!"
628,5,Simply Wonderful!,"Hi, I'm Toney. I'm a 17 year old music lover, and an avid Musical Theatre performer. A good friend of mine introduced me to Jason Robert Brown, and I must say, since then, I've been addicted. Long, Long Road is most definitely my favorite of this album. I actually heard it for the 1st time at a showchoir competition, it was a groups ballad, thier rendition was wonderful, but afterwards, I purchased this CD, and again, JRB proved himself to be wonderful. I'm a young spirit, but definitely a fan, and I make certain to introduce my friends to what ""real"" music is. Jason Robert Brown's work is a prime example!"
629,4,Jahn Garcia Lives,"I am a huge fan of John Garcia (especially Kyuss and Unida), and was excited to hear this album. It is good, but not great. While Garcia's singing holds up, musically this band is not on par with his previous outfits. Still, a good listen."
630,2,"Slow paced and repetitive, minimalist","Gorecki's Quartet No. 3 performed by Kronos is not to everyone's taste even if they love classical music. It has a very special atmosphere --slow paced and repetitive, minimalist--only broken by the third movement: Allegro, sempre ben marcato. One could use it for meditation, as it is quite peaceful and monotonous with tiny changes happening in the harmony. Perhaps it would be useful for putting one to sleep. Yes, I think it could well be advertised for insomniacs and somnambulists."
631,2,There's nothing in the Airs,"The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad."
632,3,Informative,"Another book, which although informative, does not introduce anything new. I enjoyed this book more than my previous reading ""America the Vulnerable"". I feel that this author has the capacity to produce some really good books along similar lines."
633,3,Volume 2=Second place,"More male vocals and hip-hop influence on this than ""The Acid Jazz Test, Volume 1"", so if the previous reviews here appeal to you, you will be even happier with ""Vol. 1,"" which includes better material by some of the same artists: instead of ""Do the Right Thing"" here, volume 1 has ""Set Me Free"" by the Bygraves,perhaps their finest tune. Jhelisa's ""All I Need"" and Karime Kendra's ""Never Give Up"" are two other standouts on volume 1. All three feature tasty female vocalists over a thick groove. Here the top tracks are Sound Assembly's ""Stoned Again"" and Brooklyn Funk Essentials' ""Stickman"""
634,1,Awful,"I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children."
635,2,Great coverage...lousy quality,"The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
636,2,Disappointing,"I thought the Cd would be good after hearing Tubthumping and Amnesia but I was wrong..I feel that other than Tubthumping and Amnesia, there isn't anything about this Cd to boast about..."
637,2,So-so,"I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
638,2,Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon,With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.
639,1,not worth it,"i thankfully got this cd for christmas, so i did not have to waste my money on it, i liked ""tubthumping"" at the time. i had no idea about what a dissapiontment it would be. it's sounds too kinda ""un-musical"" i have no idea where they got some of those sounds from, but it's nothing that should be used it hte future. i have had this album for a whole year and still havn't listned to the whole thing.so, sample the rest of the somgs on a cd before you put it on your christmas wish-list!!!"
640,1,This knife is Safe for no one,"This knife is terrible. It was cheap, so I should have been dubious about quality. Save your money for a better knife since you can easily cut yourself with this knife. It's made of cheap plastic and soft metal parts, so don't count on the blade locking properly. It's an insult to even have a fire fighter logo. Don't make the same mistake in buying this poorly constructed tool."
641,2,PBS caves in to RealTV,"This series is a huge disappointment, in comparison with the fine nature programming I grew up with on public television. The scientific content here is low, and thus the educational value is poor. Instead, we are treated to disaster porn--stitched-together footage of calamaties and their aftermaths, plus alleged ""human interest"" stories as shameless as anything on the six o'clock news. Insultingly voyeuristic, if that's possible for Americans these days."
642,2,Disappointed,"I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP."
643,3,Frustrating!!!,"I have owned this printer for about a year ... purchased it for printing photos and was impressed with the quality. However, like one of the other reviewers, mine jams again & again. It feeds multiple pieces of paper and is just a pain in the ***. At $1/sheet for photo paper, jams are expensive and the ink just pools while it is jammed. It is a mess and a waste of ink and therefore $$$$. HP has been NO help as their warranty/technical support is for something ridiculous .. 3 months? Anyway, I've now purchased 2 printers in the last week, both are not as good in quality of photos .. they deliver a pinkish cast (Epson Stylus CX3200 & HP1200 (I think) ). I will try a Canon next I believe ..."
644,3,One major draw back!!,The printer does deliver a nice quality picture and was easy to install. Its major disappointment is the cost of ink cartridges and the rate at which it uses ink. (Even when printing in gray scale). I now know to more thoroughly research the next printer I purchase for its long term efficiency and costs of ink. As far as usage goes the printer has worked well for over a year without any problems or crazy complications.
645,1,Extremely unhappy,"I hate this printer! It is nothing but problems. Every single time I go to print even a single page, there is some sort of problem! The paper jams, I get timeout errors, the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits. The thing has a mind of it's own and starts spewing out pages even when I'm not trying to print anything. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't put trash on each page wasting my paper. It's a piece of junk! 1 Star is highly overrating this product!"
646,3,Mixed Feelings,"I bought this printer about a month ago and was slightly disappointed by its performance. The print quality is great, the photos I printed looked 99% like the 35mm prints that came from the lab, but I made the mistake of using 4x6 photo paper instead of the standard 8 1/2 x 11 sheets. Approximately every-other print came out crooked on the paper, and the printer has an annoying habit of cutting off the last inch of the image because of margin restrictions. I couldn't find an option to use the maximum paper margins, and so had to end up making a white border around the image so that the printout didn't look strange.I bought this printer as a replacement for a 5-year-old Epson brand, and am considering going back to it because of my frustrations with this HP. Summary: Great print quality and speed, but not good with custom paper sizes."
647,1,Save your money--buy something else.,"I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support ""if you are still having trouble."" I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer. HP no longer means quality!!!"
648,3,"Ok film,the earliest Duke movie I've seen",I was excited as this is the oldest Duke movie I have seen. It is shocking to see him so young but he still looks the same and his acting is brill. This doesn't last long though.
649,4,Little Critters,All of these books that I have ordered are excellant. My grandaughter has me read them at least three times a day. We are both very happy w/ them.
650,1,Made myself finish this one to say I'd read it,"I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."
651,4,Fantastic !!! Start a petition for a Movie Version !!!,"More like 4.975 Stars. If we had more books like this, who would watch TV. This book should be required reading in College Literature classes. I would love to see a well produced movie(s) for the Foundation Series - But nothing could ever be as entertaining as Asimov's fluid writing."
652,1,Foundation,"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."
653,1,Foundation [is not good],"...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work."
654,4,Give the man SOME credit,"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for ""inaccuracy"" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."
655,4,Will any human institutions evolve?,"Oh how avidly I read these long ago. Just ate them up. After learning Paul Krugman was influenced by theses novels, I had to read them again or so I thought. Dry though relevant ideas from a great mind; two thirds through the first, not one dialog with a female or a child. Really can't go on."
656,2,"Good politics, but no science","The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."
657,5,The greatest sci-fi book ever,"If you only read one sci-fi book this should be the one. Complex ideas delivered in a simple way, a great story written in an elegant style. I hunted down the hardback version because I know that this is one series I will want to re-read."
658,3,Maybe I'm missing something...,"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."
659,3,this story is a very slow paced,when I was child we read this story and did essays in high school ... today I find it hard to follow the story line or read more then a few pages at a time.
660,4,What You'd Expect from a Sci-Fi Classic,"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read. Some of Asimov's ideas of future civilizations invoke awe even decades later. My only complaint is that the reader only gets to experience each generation for a single chapter, so character development is tricky and brief. Not as good as Ender's Game, but still worth reading."
661,3,Very relevant today,"I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."
662,2,Not my style,"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."
663,2,first but not the best,"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated ""encyclopedia galactica"" entries was awkward and rough."
664,5,MAGNIFICENT!,"First I should say that this is a great book. It is the second book in the Foundation Trilogy. And if you need some help on the order of the books, here tis : 1)Prelude to Foundation 2)Forward the Foundation 3)Foundation 4)Foundation and Empire 5)Second Foundation 6)Foundation's Edge 7) Foundation and Earth. #s 3,4, and 5 are the original trilogy. I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"
665,5,Foundation,"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole ""Foundation"" idea, but it does stand on its own."
666,3,Mediocre at best.,"I was disappointed with the Foundation books. I thought the story was thin. Surprisingly, the best of the Foundation novels is not the first but the fourth - Foundation's Edge. I don't understand what all the hoopla is about these books; they're ok, but definately not something I would reread. If you're looking for truly exciting sci-fi about the human condition and empire-building I would suggest trying Herbert's Dune."
667,2,I just cant do it.,I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.
668,2,Dissatified,"I was dissatisfied with this novel. Being an avid fan of Asimov and the Foundation series,the younger version of the mathimatical genius did not match with older one who changed the history of his race for the better; nor did I think that the story with female very appealing, again it did not match. The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel. It is unfortunate that the writer who invented the positronic brain,the three law of robotics, and of course the genuis of the foundation series wrote such a tacked on story."
669,1,"Goes ""Haywire"" Regularly","Setup was easy enough, but this printer routinely goes haywire, spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print. I have tried it with several different PCs, with this same intermittent weird behavior. Only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything.I'm off to buy an Epson!"
670,1,Don't do it!,"I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer."
671,2,passable movie yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored,"This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having ""A list"" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one."
672,2,Drawn out,"After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film."
673,3,OK Movie,This was a typical cop show and if you are looking for some pretty mindless entertainment this movie hits the spot.
674,1,SUCKS,this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.
675,1,"Horrible acting, writing, directing",All the other bad reviews are good enough for me. I'm just adding my vote on this one as a one star. I can't fathom how the ones who ranked it as 5 stars saw the same movie as I did. The best thing about this movie was returning it to the Red Box I rented it from.
676,2,Ethanol is for drinking,"I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home."
677,1,Not a tribute -- a disgrace!,"A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. The idea is enticing, but the quartet's execution is awful. Truly terrible. Dull. Choppy. Uninteresting. Same. I'd say boring, but I can't stand to listen to it long enough to get bored. It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just ""The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M."" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too. Sorry to say it, but this CD is truly awful!"
678,5,Love these laces!,"I ordered these lock laces to use in a pair of winter boots. It has made putting the boots on a speedy process, and the boots fit snugly when the laces are locked in place. I will buy this product again."
679,4,Lock Lace Brown,"Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. I use the locks on other items, works great holding my hat on in windy weather."
680,2,"2 Unlimited is back, but not as you'd expect them to.","They're back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song ""Wanna Get Up"" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there's no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On ""Wanna Get Up"" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the ""SASH! Extended Edit"" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings."
681,2,Finches love it but so do squirrels,"This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now."
682,1,horrid DVD,"Love the show, which for me has held up well: it's obviously dated but still makes me laugh.What didn't make me laugh, though, was the quality of this DVD. The quality of the transfer, it's as though you're still watching it on VHS! It doesn't support surround-sound, even by just repeating the two channels.There are no subtitles in any language, and no special features of any kind!Worse, mine had scratches right out of the plastic! The scene where Jack comes up to the breakfast table in his speedos is all pixelated. Was that true for anybody else?"
683,5,FANTASTIC,"Wow, its about time. This is one of the best comedies ever made. It's sincere and fun. While a tad naughty at times, it NEVER disgusts or embarrasses parents in front of their kids. Todays comedies should learn from such a well made show. This collection will entertain for decades to come. I hope all the episodes are made available soon."
684,5,Come And Knock On Our Door.........,I was THRILLED to find this at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I LOVED this show growing up and now owning it and watching it again just makes me smile and brings back those memories. What a great show. We we always think of John Ritter fondly and miss him greatly.
685,4,good buy i wish they added more,there is only half a dozen episodes here. still they are pretty good. recommendedd if you can find it cheap
686,5,Dead Moon Is The Best Thing Going In Rock 'N Roll Today,"While Dead Moon's ""studio"" albums are nothing short of brilliant, anyone who has seen them live knows that they are beyond comparison. Which is why both Dead Moon live albums are so great. As opposed to most live albums, which are all dolled up and clean, Dead Moon live albums are the closest thing to being there. Definately a great purchase."
687,2,Do not buy this camera,"Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this. I was really disappointed, I returned mine.. I wish there was a way to fix it."
688,5,Is it that it's green?,"I don't see how this is any different from the conventional (non-pet) lint rollers, except maybe that the handle is green? My dog likes to chew on this one more? Regardless, it works well (just as well as the regular version) for pulling coarse dog hair off just about everything. And so far, the handle has stood up to a few good chewing sessions."
689,3,The Buddhist Catechism,There was a lot of really good information in this book for those who are looking to know more about Buddhism but there were also several pages in the book which I found to be a little illrevilant to the common layperson.
690,4,A Good Synopsis of Mainstream Buddhism,"The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book."
691,4,good book,Its a very interesting layout for this sort of book. Its in a question/answer format so it makes it really easy to understand
692,3,"Good quality sound and vision, concert is OK","Nice concert from a skilled band, sound and vision are OK. This is not top class but enjoyable if you like jazzy blues."
693,4,Still One of the Best,"A number of books about substance abuse have come out since ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,"" but it still should be on the bookshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Gordon's straightforward description of the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms endured by a recovering addict has a powerful universality. It helps all of us understand the complex and excruciating process of recovery. - Ann Seymour, author of ""I've Always Loved You"""
694,4,great read,"You will cry. laugh, and love right along with this author as she dealves into the truth of dealing her with personal demons. So many ways to relate to this experience."
695,4,"Not true ""Island Style"", but good fun.","With Cold Water you won't get the Hawaiian vibe of a pidgin vocal, but you can certainly enjoy excellent slack key phrasing and very capable compositional power. A treat for fans of finger style guitar."
696,5,Best book written on lung cancer!!,"My husband was diagnosed with lung cancer more than 4 years ago, and I honestly do not know how I made it for almost 4 years without this book. It answers almost every conceivable question a person might have about lung cancer, and is the most comprehensive book on lung cancer, written in laymen's terms and very easy to read and understand, that I have ever found. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been diagnosed, or has a loved one who has been diagnosed with lung cancer."
697,1,Mean Guns Doesn't Mean Any Good,"This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing."
698,2,A very strange and bad movie,"Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for ""Omega Doom"" and ""Crazy Six"", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. ""Mean Guns"" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film."
699,2,"A lovely book, but short on specifics.","This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."
700,1,Avoid,"I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
701,4,VERRRRRYYYYYYY GOOD,"This movie is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this movie hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes.but the action is the reason to watch this. The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of."
702,4,Buy It!,"The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
703,4,Remember the Night Rider,"I loved the Mad Max movies,the first one is pretty good if you haven't watched it in a long time.I've never liked racing movies or high-speed pursuit movies except the Mad Max films...it's just good old-fashion action without slow-motion moments or re-hashed effects you see in modern movies.The movie has one thing I wished they changed-the legendary villian known as the Night Rider dies at the beginning of the film,yet throughout the film the biker gang he led honors his name deeply yet throughout the story you just don't get to see what made the Night Rider so legendary.Overall a good film."
704,3,Not quite mad enough yet,"In a post-apocalyptic Australia, Max (Mel Gibson) and his fellow officers try to keep order on the highways as nihilistic biker gangs grow ever bolder. We are given the definite impression that the final bastions of civilization are on their last legs as chaos encroaches.This film presents intriguing characters and a suitably bleak scenario. It starts strong, but it loses its energy before the end. Perhaps I was spoiled by seeing the classic action sequel ""The Road Warrior"" first. When Max goes mad at the end of this first film, director George Miller doesn't set the action sequences up very well or provide much of a payoff. The most exciting set pieces actually come much earlier in the movie. However, his next film will prove that he can be a master of action."
705,3,Good quality but censored,"I don't recommend this edition. Ok, the picture is good and the Australian language track is quite cool but the movie is cut.In the scene in which Max visits the burned Goose in hospital has been censored meaning Goose's burned body isn't shown. Ok, maybe that's something not everybody wants to see but if I buy a special edition I expect to see the whole movie."
706,3,To understand how it all started watch Mad Max.,I say that Mad Max is not as good as the others but you need to see it to understand whats going on and you need to watch Road Warrior first.
707,4,Mad Max,"Perhaps the only true Mad Max Movie and the one that makes the most sense(Or not?) good acting by Mel, Great Action and Cool Vehicles. Compared to what comes later in this franchise it actually makes sense in retrospect."
708,2,Mad Max 1,"I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars."
709,3,American dialog has ruined this movie.,"The original Australian theatrical release is best. This DVD looks fine. It has a crisp picture and good sound. I was however extremely dissapointed to hear the POORLY overdubbed American voices and miss certain cut sequences. Not only that but there are NO special features or extended menus, just a chapter search. This movie DESERVES a special studio upgrade. It must be remastered, uncut and include trailers, commentry, interviews etc. Mad Max is a new wave masterpeice and must be given the attention it's worthy of."
710,3,Best of the trilogy,The First was the Best..Simple story.. Violent .. but the ending could of been improved with a nice revenge (finished too quick) The 2nd one was dead slow but Not too bad and the third was kiddy violent..
711,1,Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen,"I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
712,3,Not mad enough,"This is an interesting film, which if occasionally a bit wooden, virtually created its own genre overnight, and made Mel Gibson a star.Perhaps its most noteable feature was George Miller's use of unusual camera angles, which created one or two iconic images. Sometimes it has the feeling of an exploitation film, but it never develops in that way and by today's standards it seems rather tame.It looks as though it was made on a pretty low budget, and I prefer the brasher sequels where a little more polish was added. It remains a film curiosity, but really not much more than that."
713,3,"A weak album, by Stereolab's standards","Having been consistently impressed with every Stereolab album I've had the chance to get my hands on, I was rather disappointed with this release. Whereas previous albums have flowed beautifully from one exceptional song to another (very different) one, this album represents a set of peaks and valleys--the peaks being far less numerous and/or unique, and the valleys being dull and virtually indistinguishable from one another.If I'm being unduly harsh, it is only because I've come to expect so much from this band. The album does in fact contain a few noteworthy songs, like Captain Easychord and Hallucinex, but these lack the uniqueness or catchiness to compete with older classics like Come and Play...Night, pack yr romantic mind or Metronomic Underground. Overall, this album is mediocre at best, and tiresome at worst. I only hope it doesn't mark the beginning of a downward spiral!"
714,3,too much musicianship not enough elemental 'lab,"this is my fave band ever. I own a whole ton of their cd's and listen to them more than any other band. This band's strong points through the years (and in their earth shattering concerts) have included experimentation with so many different genres, and yet making these genres surprisingly their own--another strongpoint has been the elemental nature to their songs-an urgent simplicity--an overpowering sound burst of pure, raw, deep sentiment--this album--while very good in many ways, feels overproduced--it just lacks that raw power of feeling and conviction that all their other albums have..."
715,3,"Ooh, a new to me author with work I like.","Never seen this author before, but well researched, coherent story. Well constructed sentences, and decent plot lines. Solid characters, credible action. It may be fiction, but other than Science fiction, I want mine to read as credible."
716,1,Mara Wilson,I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part
717,1,Poor quality,"I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well."
718,2,Ask Santa for some ear plugs,"Home for Christmas. Sounds innocent enough. But you would be well advised to stay away from this home. It is a horrible place. You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd. Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate. How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes. But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must. After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!"
719,2,Disappointing. Too much talk...not enough music.,"Only about 1 hour long, and most of this is talking. Somewhat interesting, but I wanted Dolby Digital Hendrix!"
720,3,Nice but who are these guys?,"The DVD was very interesting but for one glaring problem. The creator fails most of time to tell the viewer whos speaking in the interviews. For the Jimi fan who doesn't know everyone that Jimi interacted w/ by face, this is very frustrating. Other than that it had some nice clean footage.I had much more fun watching the Jimi Hendrix Story DVD...BR>Even though it is presented in Mono."
721,4,The Beginning Of Time,"While not nearly as engaging as Exterminator! or Naked Lunch, this shows an epic quality to his style and a tie-in centered around some ancient myth of the time before time, (when the world was advanced enough to cause its own demise) and using it as plot points for the strange tales evoked; from guerilla uprisings to life as it once was, to the pandemonium of the future. Fantastic introduction, calling on mythical demons and whatnot. Recollecting the events is, of course, foggy and chopped into so many fragments of absolute brilliance in hindsight; however not quite on top of his game."
722,5,One of the best books by L.J Smith,This was such a great book. I loved it. It was beyond sweet. I love Quinn. I wish I could meet a guy like him. L.J Smith is the best author in the world. I have read everyone of her books and they all are Da Bomb.
723,5,More Night World,"I can read these books over and over, but especially this one. It's my favourite. I started reading them over two years ago, and I still like them, whereas other books I have grown out of. There was something about Rashel and Quinn that I really liked though. I hope she writes more, and I wish they were easier to find! ............"
724,3,Just a Moment,"Even though I knew the recording would be in old style,I was surprised at the poor quality of the CDThe service from the company sending the CD was outstanding.So 2 stars for the CD and 5 stars for the service.JimO."
725,4,"Good quality, needs a guide picture on the front","My daughters love this puzzle. We've had it over a year, and it's still in good shape. Nothing peeling or splitting, just some chew marks from my younger daughter. What's more, they still pull it out to play with after all this time. My only problem is that there is no picture of the puzzle on the front of the assembling board, only a small picture of it on the back. I'm used to doing puzzles where I have a picture to guide me. But my daughters have learned to put it together by matching similar colors or shapes, which is a good educational value too. For the price, I highly recommend it, even without the picture."
726,3,Madonna sounds amazing,"Madonna sounds amazing. Her voice is expressive and has awesome power and range. She easily carries the soundtrack. The other leads, Antonio Banderas & Johnathan Pryce are excellent as well. The reason this CD gets only 3 stars is because as great as the vocals are and as nice as the production values are; it still sounds like a 70's bloated rock opera! On screen this is a good thing. The overwraught melodrama adds to the grandeur and scope of the film, but, doesn't work as stand alone music. The exception is the new ballad ""you must love me"" which is passionate and heartbreaking in it's simplicity. BTW: Don't get this if you're looking for the radio version of ""don't cry for me Argentina"". That's a remix and available on the cd-single; not here."
727,3,Music,The CD isn't bad except that a lot of the songs are over played. Madonna does a great job of singing as always. I was surprised that Antonio Bandaras could sing so beautifully.
728,3,Madonna sounds amazing,"Madonna sounds amazing. Her voice is expressive, has power and range. She easily carries the soundtrack.

729,5,Madonna is so good!,Madonna is the best singer on this cd. Her singing and voice is so angelic. The rest of the cast is superb.
730,1,Disappointed in product quality and support,"After returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams, the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them. In trying to overcome this through HP's support line, the recorded message said I would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call (twice). Returned that version also."
731,4,Definitely Brief,"I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database."
732,4,good bed for a good price,"The bed is fairly comfortable and very convenient with the air pump already build in. After some time, it does lose air, but overall it is a good bed for the price."
733,2,Came with a Leak,"Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn..."
734,1,Used it once before it broke,I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for.
735,1,"A small leak, right out of the box","I had to try sleeping on it the first night - in a couple of hours it was less firm, which made it difficult to roll around on. It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough). Prospective buyers should be mindful of this."
736,3,Returning it,"I bought this mattress to have as an option for when guests visit from out of town. I tried it out right away to make sure it didn't have holes, etc. I pumped up the mattress until it was firm, but noticed that the firmness went away pretty quickly--no one was laying or sitting on it, it was just standing alone yet losing firmness. There weren't even any sheets or blankets on it. I thought maybe I hadn't pumped the mattress up enough, so I filled it with more air. Same problem. I deflated the mattress and tried again the following day. Same issue. It's just not worth having an okay air mattress when I have had pretty great air mattresses (unfortunately the one I loved is being borrowed indefinitely by a family member and I can no longer find it in stores). I'm returning this and continuing my search."
737,1,Waste of Money,I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.
738,4,Great for the money,I bought this air mattress because I was going to be having several different visitors in the next couple months. I've asked every person who has stayed with me if the mattress was comfortable and they all said that they got good night sleeps. It is also so quick and easy to inflate and deflate. The only question is trying to get the mattress back in the bag for storage. All in all for the money it was def. worth it and I'm glad I purchased them.
739,2,Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.,"Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it."
740,5,Perfect for grandchildren,We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it.
741,4,good,it is very good in cleaning but the drain pipe is not made of good material in the sense that you can't fold it well so it will give problem as water spread everywhere otherwise it cleaned the clothes very well.
742,5,This is great!,I love this airbed! It is so easy to inflate and deflate! We bought it for my 6 year old for sleep overs and works great. We are going to take it on vacation with us so we don't have to rent a cot.It is very comfy and soft with it's velour cover. I would recommend it to anyone!
743,4,Excellent bed and for the price. Sets up quickly.,I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.
744,3,Comfortable with small leak,It is good except that it leaks a small amount of air overnight. The leak is small enough that you can make ith through the night.
745,2,It would be great if it stayed inflated!,"I have purchased two of these air mattresses. When inflated, they are great. But, during the night, they slowing deflate. I have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours. I wish I would have bought a different air mattress."
746,1,bubble bed,This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh
747,5,Ecelente producto,"Funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas.Recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado.Muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento, no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo."
748,2,WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN,"THIS IS THE THIRD MATTRESS IN 5 OR 6 WEEKS AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH ALL THREE. THEY ALL LEAKED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, SOME WORSE THEN THE OTHERS. THE BUILT IN PUMP WORKED GREAT AND I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. THUS THE 2 STARS INSTEAD OF ONE STAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR AMAZON'S GREAT RETURN POLICY. IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH THEM."
749,2,"decent for price, only one fall back so far","I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and used it for the first time last night. It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in."
750,2,Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised,"I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope."
751,2,misgivings,"The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
752,4,Intex pillow rest twin airbed,This was great for our recent vacation to the snowBoth my daughters brought their beds and were quite comfortable the entire tripEasy to blow up but not easy to get back into the travel bagI rated it 4 stars for this reason
753,1,Beware of the dimensions,"I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
754,5,Comfortrable,"The day before my guest arrived, I opened the box, took out the bed, plugged it in and it was inflated in less than three minutes. My guest slept on it for a week and I never had to add air. He said he was very comfortable and that he would buy one for his apartment to use for his guests."
755,4,Inflatible bed,This bed works perfectly for me. I have a lot of family members who visit for the weekend and it is easy to set up and very comfortable.
756,2,Is loosing air with ALMOST NO USE!!,"I bought this airbed on October 2009, I only used it 3 times and now is loosing air!! How can it loose air like that with only 3 uses?? At the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall, but now I can't use it anymore unless I want fill it with air at the middle of the night."
757,4,Great Bed,"I bought this to keep under the bed in my toddlers room. Was packaged great, blew up fast..less than three minutes and wasn't a problem to deflate either. The bed itself is ok, I wouldn't say COMFY because it is an air mattress and in't meant for long term use, but as far as air beds go.. this one is nice."
758,2,Intext Pillow Rest Twin Airbe,"I was so excited when I received this air bed, but after sleeping on it on the first night, things changed. Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm. There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump"
759,1,"Got ""Burnt"" By Rays","This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
760,5,Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History,"This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
761,1,Yuck,"This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it ""air out,"" all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, ""Ewww, what's that smell."" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage."
762,2,A Little Too Much,"I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me."
763,1,Defective/No Return,"When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase."
764,1,Doesn't work,"I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing..."
765,3,A little big..,"I didn't expect this item to be so LARGE, and the vibrations are not as strong as I had hoped. Although, the overall quality is terrific. It's very jelly-like, and it's unlikely to break at all because the beads are metal and not just thrown in there. I still haven't been able to use it yet because it's sooooo thick, I'm hoping I'll be able to with some help from my fiancee."
766,2,I didn't think it was that good.,Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.
767,2,broke one first use,First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy
768,1,Very Cheap,"I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer."
769,2,Large and Hard!,"Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again."
770,5,Damn,You're an idiot if you don't buy this. I lasted maybe 30 seconds. Better than any boyfriend I've ever had- hello new best friend
771,1,Awful,"I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."
772,3,HUGE,"unbelievably HUGE. like crazy thick. scary. This is only good for when you're very ..ehem... ""ready for it"".beware. I don't recommend starting off with this... it was actually painful."
773,2,Too big!,"While I LOVE the jack rabbit feature, the vibrator is overall too big for me to use. I can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable. Maybe because its too big, I cannot feel the beads at all, I don't think they have any room to move. The vibrator is also quite heavy. It would be perfect if it were more slender. So girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product."
774,5,She loves it,My wife was scared to use this when I took it out and showed it to her but now she loves it. We play with it about 5 times a week
775,1,disappointed,"I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response."
776,3,Its Not Strong Enough.,"While the first general sensation is pleasing, the batteries dont last very long and the vibrations and twisting beads aren't strong enough."
777,4,Wow wow wow wow,Now this one is amazing. My husband and I were enjoying ourselves tonight and he used this on me and I absolutely LOST IT. It was amazing omg I screamed like haven't in along time. It made me feel so good lol. LOVE IT!!!!!!
778,4,Works well,The product came quickly and discretely. The vibrator is very strong with three settings. I would just caution that shaft portion is fairly thick and may caused discomfort if not use to the size.
779,1,The worst ever,"This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash."
780,5,Best $20 you will ever spend,"I bought this vibe about a month ago. IT is Fantastic! the best $20 I have ever spent, worth 2x the price.-Yes, it smells like plastic, I dont know why people are turned off by that. Its a vibe...made out of plastic.--The vibration is great, the perfect amount. there are two buttons, one controls the bunny ears the other controls the rotation of the shaft. Personally, I dont use the rotation often but the bunny ears bullet is wonderful. They do not irritate me however, I can see why some would complain if they have very sensitive skin.came in working order, and have had no problems since.takes 3 AA batsI recommend to all my friends!"
781,5,Does wat I need!!,For me its a perfect fit and takes me to jus the right places!! N I luv the waterproof component!!!
782,1,Ehh.,"It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product."
783,5,Pretty Darn Good,"This product works for me. I'm a first time buyer and am pretty happy with my purchase! I read a few reviews complaining about how much noise the product makes but its really not too bad. If you have a fan or a TV on you're good. Also others were complaining about the smell, but its only noticeable if you put your nose right up on the device."
784,1,YOU DON'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS,"This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this ""Album"" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back."
785,5,"You Know What, Ya'll? - Glenn can SAAAAAAANG!!","Upon intial inspection, the average listener will think this is yet another classics cd with nothing fresh going on.First and foremost, Glenn has been a highly underrated singer. All his career we know he was in the background, you always marveled at his vocal acuity, yet somehow he just couldn't seem to ""get over.""Notwithstanding, this is a beaaaaaaaaautiful cd. Glenn indeed breathes new life in some timeless classics. He even tightened up ""Show & Tell"" a song, I wasn't that crazy about when first released but this is yet a perfect example of Glenn breathing freshness into some wonderful R&B; classics. Kudos goes to his female partner on 'Where is the Love"" and ""My First Love."" These guys are saaaaangin' ya'll, okay?I really feel good about giving a guy who has been out there in the trenches for quite a while his flowers now. He has managed to present a wonderful project that he can be proud of and that you will enjoy for years to come!"
786,5,Brio Ramp Tracks,Brio is the most durabile wooden train set on the market. It has outstanding durability and quality. No other manufacterer on the market can compare. These are a must for any train set. It allows the child to build entrances and exits to his/her train roadway. Excellent.
787,4,Love the printer-hate having to chase paper,I love this printer - my only complaint is that it shoots the paper out - you would think they could have a decent paper trayinstead of shooting my still damp photos across the room.
788,2,Epson is better and bad software driver,"My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!"
789,2,Disappointed,"I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. It has completely broken down, will not acknowledge that it has paper, and the ""carriage"" is broken. It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams. I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the ""carriage"" is so expensive. Though it does print beautiful photos, I am very disappointed with this product's performance over time!"
790,5,WONDERFULL FLUSH MOUNTS,"I purchased this flush mount,and they look much better than pictured.the base are metal and the color are antique brass finish.the design on the metal base is matching the design on the lampshade.I am very pleased with this lamp and it took me no time to assembled it."
791,1,one elephant charm? you've got to be kidding.,"when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?"
792,1,Great idea--terrible design!,"Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!"
793,1,"Bad Design, just buy the figures","We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. The elevator uses a string pulley which promptly bound around the gear that connects it to the thumbwheel which raises and lowers the platform. Within 5 minutes of playing, one of the main features broke. Also, the top has a ring with 5 rockets, one of these came missing a retaining pin. Thoroughly disappoingting as he is a big Justice League fan."
794,2,A toy not made to last,This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.
795,3,Bad Experience that ended well,"Received VA912B was bad with text appearing as areas of light and dark contrast in bands down the screen which made text almost unreadable (also dead pixel mid-screen after a few days). Called Viewsonic support and they did the replacement policy where they send a new one and you return flawed one back in 10 days (their shipping expense). Monitor never arrived and I called back to find out it was out of stock. They agreed to send another model and it never arrived. I called back and they said they couldn't ship another model. So back and forth with numerous, long waits and calls and some very tense arguements. Received a new monitor after about 5 weeks and it was good. I am very pleased with all operational aspects of the 912. Display is very crisp, clear, and fast but was sure painful and long process to get to this point."
796,2,Dead Pixels,I've had this ViewSonic model for a little over a year. It has been good to be until now. I have been losing pixels every week for the past month. I'm out 25-30 pixels. Aren't products suppose to last longer then this?
797,3,3 stars,"Three friends share a monthly ritual of meeting for cocktails. Each of the women, Maggie, Roxanne, and Candice, has her own trauma to deal with, one that threatens to topple her into an abyss of despair. Maggie is coping with new motherhood and the associated depressing parts of it. Roxanne is the other woman for a married man, and Candice is paying for her father's mistakes, perhaps more than she bargained on doing. It only takes one malicious interloper to almost wreck the three's friendship and Candice's life, but when the women remember their friendship, nothing can stop them.*** Although the ending is almost too good to be true, the power of friendship is something that shines through clearly. Candice's story tends to be the dominant one, and is interesting enough to fill an entire book, but without Maggie and Roxanne's to be supportive, it would founder. ***Amanda Killgore"
798,5,Love that Sophie Kinsella has more books under her real name,"The book started out a bit slow as it built characters, but then becomes completely engulfing and such a fun escape into the characters lives that I didn't want the book to stop."
799,5,A good summer read,"This is unlike the other books that i have read so far. the plot revolves around a bar and three best friends. They are good at their jobs,articulate and know what they want from life. But a crazy flat-mate, an affair with a superior and motherhood corode their friendship and their lives-almost. This book is about true friendship and how it can get you through the day and lives problems big or small. A good read that cannot be put down."
800,2,hard to read--both format and content,"This book is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word ""pleasure"" spelled out as one word. ""Plea sure""? Is that a British thing? Many many words where there were mysterious hyphens, words broken into syllables ""so ci a ble"" was one. Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor."
801,4,Good!,"I really enjoyed this book. I must admit, that although Sophie Kinsella and Madeleine Wickham are the same author; I do prefer Kinsella over Wickham. However, this is still a great, worthwhile book! GOOD STUFF!"
802,3,A triangle of friends,"This book was a really easy read.. however.. a little predictable.From the ""evil"" girl who plots against the other girls.. to the love interest. I don't want to have too many spoilers.Definitely a beach read but not a read if you're looking for anything deep and meaningful"
803,5,Loved by recipient!!,"I bought these as a gift for my daughter-in-law because she was complaining about the ones that are like earrings and were so hard to use. Her guests weren't using them! I had bought her some magnetic ones before, so got on line and searched and found these. She was so pleased and that pleased me. These are so easy to use and come in different designs.(golf, etc.)"
804,1,Eby dead! 12/27/02,"Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime. FALSE PROPHET ALERT"
805,3,Service was prompt,"Service was prompt, got my book in a timely manner. Didn't expect book to be so old though."
806,1,Wow.. can't believe i paid money for this,This book's got coffee stain all over and in the poorest condition. Can't believe i paid 5 dollars for this crap
807,4,i dont get it,i do not understand this book but it was still good but I think I will get one with the easier version. I also think it was written four hundred years ago. So its still good.
808,5,Required reading for freshman,Ordered this book since it was required reading for my freshman son. It was exactly what the teacher requested. Shipping was fast and book was in good shape. Thanks!
809,5,"Quick delivery, excellent product",I was very pleased with the condition of this book. It contained no marks and seemed new!
810,5,This is the only one tragedy that I enjoyed so much,The language of the book is really hard to read. I spent a lot of time before I finished the first Scene. But it is also enjoyable to read. Shakespeare did not write Romeo and Juliet. He just told story from Italian literature in his own words.
811,2,RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!,"We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!"
812,5,The pure essence of love,"I won't summarize the plot, as it is one of the best-known tales in all literature, and deservedly so. Being a classic, it can be read from different perspectives and standpoints. For me, it is a study on passion, of instantaneous, immediate and eternal passion of love; absolute and without doubts; pure and immaculate. The lovers never have to discover the realities of living together. Their love stays in an absolute state of pureness. So, it is a vision of love in its most extreme state.Shakespeare's true genius can be observed in the fact that all of his plays, especially this one, can and have been adapted to a wide array of ages, places and circumstances. The story is universal because so is the passion it examines.The characters are unbelievably strong and accurate. The environment is wonderful Middle Ages Italy. The plot is twisted yet simple, and the Bard's sentences are pure poetry of the highest kind. No one should die without having read ""Romeo and Juliet""."
813,4,A must have,"If you're a Dolly Parton fan (even somewhat of a fan), this is a must have for your collection. It will NOT disappoint!!"
814,1,Bad cutting and way too big,"It's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. I ordered size M as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. It's way too big. I exchanged it for size S. I have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well. It's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. Thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. Very ill fitting."
815,2,Doesn't fit well/hard to take off,"I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model's costume. The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy. The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4"", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top. The cut of the top made me look flat (34B). I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing. Overall it was cute--but it just looks so much better on the model."
816,2,hmm...,"I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it."
817,1,Color selection.,"I find it very frustrating not to be able to choose my own color! If this practice was changed, I might order this product!"
818,1,Disappointed,"I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!"
819,2,"no color, no buy","I wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter, but was afraid I'd end up with black. So......a lost sale for this company. Sorry!"
820,4,Two sides to every coin,"'The most dangerous man alive'? Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson."
821,1,Most Dangerous Man Alive...Yeah right!,"To label Charles Manson ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"" is a farce. He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer. This book well written, therefore it could not have come from his words or hands. Then again, he has always used others to do his bidding via murder or writing. Believe what you want but I believe it is pure horse manure, although entertaining."
822,2,"Lies, Lies, Lies","For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it."
823,4,A story with a nice twist that will leave you thinking,"Mike Connors was in the wrong place at the wrong time and now he is talking to Blue. Blue has something special to share with Mike, Blue is a serial kiler who is stalking the people of the small town where Mike lives. Blue wants to shre his thoughts and feelings with Mike, but Mike doesn't want to know. Mike is also making Blue angry - something that he really doesn't want to do. This gripping book will keep you glued to your seat from the opening scene to the spine tingling twist at the end of the story. An intense read that will leave you thinking long after you have turned the last page and closed the book."
824,3,Where are the missing chapters?,I now realize that I am not the only one who enjoyed the three books but I too felt that several chapters had been omitted.I was left with the distinct impression that the author decided he was tired of writing this last book and just quit. I would have had second and third thoughts about investing my time if I knew in advance that David was just going to up and quit on the series.
825,1,anthology,This book is an anthology of 3 books I had already read. I do not knowingly purchase anthol;ogies. O would not recomend this book unless yoy want all 3 books in one.
826,5,superior space opera,"If you are looking for sci-fi that deals with important, redeeming issues then keep moving. The 3 novels that comprise this series are pure space opera. That being said, the characters are engaging and sympathetic. I never dreamed that one of my favorite characters in a novel would actually be the Moon!My only complaint is that the story feels incomplete. I've been waiting for a 4th book that I fear will never arrive."
827,5,Three Great Books in One!,Empire From the Ashes tells a great story. This reprint worth buying if you don't already own the three paperback versions. Where's the fourth book? I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for.
828,5,Empire from the Ashes,"Excellent newer release (2003) from Baen, but don't be fooled - this is the three book Dahak series released under a new title. It includes: Mutineer's Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, and Heirs of Empire. This is not a fourth book in this entertaining series."
829,5,How many times have I read this?,"I really don't know.Just finished re-reading it again, and still cried in parts, and was still left with a broad smile at the very end. (Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it. (I'm paraphasing).That is truly disappointing, because although I love most of his other books (I stopped reading Honor at about 12), this is his best work.Oh well...I only have to wait 5 more months for the next Merlin book."
830,2,Great For First Timers,"While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers."
831,5,Superior dance/trance to close out 2002,"This CD single is smokin'!! The mixes are not offensive, but they are not as good as the widely listened to Radio Edit. They have a great record here...hands down!!"
832,4,eclectic electrica,"OBK is definitely the ""musica latina"" version of Depeche Mode (Speak&Spell time period). With haunting-dark vocals, basic bouncy beats and synthpop noise...you'll be sure to like it. There are a lot of wonderful artists/groups in the Latin Pop genre, but not too many go for the full electronic/synth sound. I give these ""dos hombres de Espana"" a lot of credit. Check out the band Moenia as well, if you like the Latin Electric sound!!"
833,2,Book to basic,"This book was very disapointing, and misleading. Like for example wing chun has no high kicks but you will see one in this book. enough said"
834,2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters."
835,1,a very poor attempt!!,"This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards. Those who said it was great, I don't suppose you read much or you only read these types of books. This book is very sad and doesn't deserve the praise it gets."
836,5,A great debut novel by a new author,"It is so good to see the vast African American talent that we have among us. Trisha Thomas has written a novel that a lot of us don't really tackle about. Our hair. She takes a real brave sister, Venus Johnston, who cuts off her hair, sends her boyfriend out of her life, and then embarks on one of her own. It is not all happy stuff here. Most of the folks she encounter are either trying to put her down,stalking her with crazy notes, and just plain being simple. Combined with the pressures of the corporate world and how she handles that, has the makings of a great debut novel. I feel the author wants to let us know that we are unique in our own way and don't need no one else to validate or tell us who we are. Brava!! or You go Girl!!!"
837,2,"Very, very cute.","If you like cute. It's okay, but you have to waid througha lot of syrupy, cloying, well, Canadianess. This stuffwould be great on Sesame Street."
838,3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book, especially as it was on clearance. I didn't like some of the main character's motives, and some of the conflicts seemed manufactured, although I suppose I've never been rocketed away from home forever. I may read a few other of this author's books before I make a final decision on his quality. I suppose the most I can say is that this book left me ambivalent at best."
839,2,Boring Characters,"I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?"
840,5,One Brave Act changes a civilization,"this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing ""object"" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read"
841,2,The Album Cover Picture is incorrect,"The album cover picture for this page is incorrect. See other offerings of ""Spanish Eyes"" by Paul McDermand for the correct image.The music is wonderful, however!!!!"
842,2,Art of Dali,I liked the book. The mix of explanations of the painting and his life was very descriptive. I learned a lot about his friends and famliy. The book just reminds me that in every genius there's a lunatic.
843,5,Beautiful Hair,This makes dull hair look fresh. It's not too much- it's perfect. I highly recommend it for those days when your hair can look somewhat dull- like in between coloring.
844,2,"Yes, just ok","I bought these at Target too. Yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. The handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. Yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. But if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, I have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. And if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. My other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so I can use the hand mixer. There's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them."
845,5,White Plastic Kitchen Bowl Set is amazing!,"I truly love cooking with these bowls. The surface makes clean-up easy and the depth allows for me to throw an unlimited amount of concoctions into it. These bowls and strong and sturdy so that they will last forever and take all the wear and tear of cooking and the dishwasher. Overall, I'm very impressed with this product."
846,1,Stained after two uses,"I bought these. After two uses (the first being a french vanilla cake, and the second fudge brownies), they stained from the brownie batter and will not come clean. I figured these would be better quality, since they ARE kitchen aid."
847,4,Boys love Batcave,"After receiving this as a bday gift for my 5 year old, I was worried after having read the reviews. However, I found that my kids are having a blast playing with the batcave. Its been a sturdy and reliable toy, and is definitly getting used. It has inspired more creative playing, too. It seems that only the batman/ justice league figures are able to use the elevator. Smaller teen titan figures got stuck and the door wouldn't open. Haven't had any problems of breakage, tipping or falling apart. So far, so good and the boys are happy!!!"
848,5,"Piece of junk? Yeah, right!","This is the best toy ever! I was worried after reading the reviews. ""Falls apart, impossible to put together"" but I found this a great toy. I am 12 and I put this toy together in 10 minutes. It falls over? Well duh, you're supposed to set it up on a wall. Even if you don't you can put one of the bottom supports in front, the other in back. Seriously, this toy rocks. It's great because it does so much cool stuff. It has an elevator that changes Bruce Wayne to Batman. It has a zipline. It inspires more creative scenarios for play. A great buy!"
849,2,Might be OK if your child is older,"My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. We got it for him and it was pretty frustrating. The parts kept falling off and the elevator has NEVER worked. For 2 days straight he played with it, broke every piece off practically, and came crying to mommy to every few minutes. That was 6 months ago. He pretty much hasn't played with it since. Too bad because he's such a batman freak.Maybe he was just too young for it. If you're buying it for a younger child...beware!"
850,1,I've been had!,"This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes."
851,1,WORST TOY EVER!,After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!
852,3,Can't find action figures to complete set!!!,Does anyone know where I can purchase the action figures to compliment this toy? I have looked every where and can only find batman. The commercial and the box show many more figures to go along with the bat cave.
853,1,a monumental waste of money,"I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!"
854,1,"Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate","My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
855,1,waste of money,"the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price."
856,4,Great Abum!!!!!! one of their best,"I have always loved Morcheeba and the way they do that coffee house sound, but this one takes it up an inch more, its very calming and awesome I recomend this to you if you are having a bad day and listing to music will make it better, this is a cd to put in your collection...."
857,3,Major Installation Problem,"Since I had a Visioneer One Touch already installed on my computer (The reason I bought this one is that the last one died. I got great service from the previous one.), I assumed the installation would go without a hitch. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. To date, I have been unsuccessful in installing the software and the scanner is sitting on my desk with my ""in box"" on top of it. I haven't had the time to sit on the phone, going through the long ""automated"" help menus.I haven't given up yet, but neither do I have a working scanner!"
858,1,Don't buy this scanner,"I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook's USB port. The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I've owned over the years, which is easy to use. However after only a few hundred scans, there's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened, resulting in a very poor scan. I'm throwing it away. Buy something else."
859,1,Intentional Obsolescence -- 2011 and it still no drivers!,"Vista has been out for 4 years, I'm up to Windows 7, and they still haven't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what's called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?"
860,1,Worst scanner I've owned.,"I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The ""auto"" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do."
861,5,A book that will stay with you always,"I read this book at the age of 14 (30 years ago) and will always be grateful to Rumer Godden for all she taught me about life. This novel, centered on the conflicts and misunderstandings between adults and children --- and their profound effects --- showed me that somewhere, there was an adult who remembered and understood the pain and confusion of adolescence."
862,3,"OK card. Easy to install, USB 2.0 works perfectly, firewire just ok.","Card installed very easily. USB 2.0 works perfectly, and this is why I bought this card, but firewire has been a little flakey. It works ok, but I have to unplug my drive and plug it back in, to get it to mount."
863,1,Not Enough Choices,There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.
864,2,Reads like a book for 8 to 12 year olds,"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"
865,5,An Excellent Novel,"This book is, without a doubt, one of the quickest reads I've ever seen. Though about 300 pages long, one could realistically breeze through it in a day. Why? Because the story flows so well as to keep one engrossed. There's never a dull moment; it's always interesting, and the profiles of the main characters are excellent and poignant. Clavell's real-life experience as a prisoner at Changi really shows, as he masterfully captures the atmosphere, mood, and times of life in a prison camp.Highly recommended."
866,5,Autobiographical historical fiction at its best,"Whether you are a fan of Clavell's Asian Saga or a casual reader, you will surely enjoy his first major book about prisoners of war at Changi in Sinapore during the Japanese occupation. Because Clavell himself spent time in the POW camp, he has a real perspective of what life was like in the camp. He is able to describe to the reader a sense of competitive community that the prisoners had amongst one another and that it seemed the Japanese hardly had a role at all. One enterprising character is able to make a great deal of money and garner a large amount of supplies at the envy of most others. The title itself has a cryptic meaning that only reading the book will dissolve...."
867,1,below par,"after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it."
868,4,A very good read,"After reading Shogun I was hungry for anything written by Clavell and went on to read King Rat (which was also made into a movie that I found to be quite good). Clavell is a master of character development and as this is one of his earliest(if not earliest) works, one can see the greatness of this author who would go on to write at least one of the best books of our time (Shogun). This book which takes place in a Japanese prison camp located in Singapore Island during WW2 and it centers on one of the few Americans imprisoned among mainly British and Australian prisoners. The American thrives in this harsh environment and manages to possess more than anyone else and has a knack for making money. It is a character study about greed, friendship, war-time relationships and social hierarchy. It's a well written book and an interesting story that is remembered long after the book is read. I highly recommend it and would have given it 4 1/2 stars if allowed."
869,3,Not durable enough,"We usually love Melissa and Doug products in our household, particularly the puzzles, but this was a disappointment. This is advertised as a wooden puzzle so many people might assume it has wooden painted pieces like the chunky style puzzles. Not so!It has wooden pieces with glossy paper glued onto the pieces. One of the pieces of paper was peeling and had already came off the number six before we even removed this puzzle from the wrapping. Not worth the money and a huge disappointment coming from a company I've come to trust."
870,3,Fun but could be better,It does exactly what it is suppose to do. The wood is cheap so expect some splintering and if a piece gets stepped on it will break. It is almost the like the wood of a Popsicle stick.
871,3,My kids like the numbers but...,the pictures are a little off. The puzzle is durable and has survived slobber. I would recommend it for someone trying to help their younger kids learn numbers/counting.
872,4,Beginner,"As a beginner crocheter I found this, my first pattern book, a delight. It was hard to choose a pattern from the 52 stylish afghans available, all illustrated with beautiful coloured photos. However, the crochet instructions were a little difficult to follow for a non-American and chart diagrams would have been a useful alternative. As would the degree of difficulty involved. But after receiving some help in deciphering the instructions, and referring to the stitch guide at the back of the book, I was able to work my way through the pattern I chose."
873,3,Bizarre but truly memorable,"Years after I read this book, I still remember the tale of the dying Building, its Owner and the Tenants. At the time I read it, I was working for a Landlord who also had trouble collecting the Rents and paying the expenses, just like in this book. Sadly, the theives and low-lifes who represented most of the building's tenants weren't that interesting to me. When the State took over the Building, things only got worse for it and the Tenants. This book was at times gross, at times funny and at times frighteningly realistic. Anyone who's ever managed (or tried to manage) slum buildings will recognize himself here. I? Well, I was just the computer guy, but working for that company scared me out of income property investments for life.I give this one three stars because I had difficulty getting through the gross passages. But the fact that I remember it over ten years after I read it must mean something, right?"
874,2,ALL images are titled left,"I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price."
875,1,"worked well, but now driver issues","This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here."
876,2,"Not great, but not bad","Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level."
877,2,Not as advertised,"My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No."
878,1,First and Last,"This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk"
879,2,Headphone jack,"I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?"
880,1,Not a fan,"I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all."
881,3,shame you couldn't get his name right,"The man's name is Ron Goodwin for heaven's sake (not Roy). He is one of the most popular light classical (some would say very light) composers of the 20th century. Earnslaw is the one I was looking for, just fantastic. The rest is OK, in fact mostly better than that, but not very demanding."
882,5,The Ultimate Guide to Freshwater Fishing,"This is a great reference book, especially for beginners. Contains tips that experienced anglers will find very useful. Though no one book will have all the answers one seeks, this one helped with a good chunk of mine. A must have and a steal for the price."
883,5,Bought 4 of these.,When somthing is worthy of remembering bought and shared with my kids. These kind of books will always be a gift for all their lives.
884,5,Christmas For The IN CROWD!,This is the best Christmas music I have ever heard! Very hip finger-snappin' funky swinging tunes! Perfect music for your holiday gatherings! Sound quality is very good! This album was originally released in 1961 and it remained on the top Christmas LP charts throughout most of the 60's.
885,3,nice snapshot,"This book started out as a nice snapshot of the characters in New Orleans. About halfway in, it devolved into a sociology disseration on the racial/class ills of the city. I grew up there and am well aware of the problems. Some of the ideas put forth by the author were simplistic at best. Otherwise, a pretty good book."
886,3,Read for a school assignment,"Although I have read many books on slavery, this one was a little different. The first couple chapters were similar to other slave stories, but it took a different turn after that. The setting and circumstances made for an interestingly different story."
887,3,Fiery snazz,"3 1/2Intimate club sit-in with Duke and his big band crew does succeed at giving enthusiasts a well recorded live experience featuring his spectacular arrangements, however with the onslaught of grunts and groans, and some of the highest horn squeals this side of Zorn, this swingin' time is not without a share of piercing indulgences, not the least is how every track requires the swanky introduction from our conductor."
888,3,Not the best quality,"I bought this CD player because it was reasonably priced but I probably would have been better off buying a portable cd player with am/fm raido with a headphone jack. When I left the anti-skip protection off, it skips at the slightest move. I also found that if I turned the anti-skip protection on, the sound quality isn't as good."
889,3,Fun at first but gets old fast,"I was hooked into this game for about a week and then beat it. It has a career mode where you start out with a few players and try to beat top teams in various cities, adding their best player when you do beat them. If you have played an NBA Street game before, you probably know the style of the game. For those who haven't played NBA Street, the game is played by ones to 21. There are also trick points where if you get a certain amout you get a gamebreaker. If you score a basket during a gamebreaker, it gives you points but also subtracts points from the opponent. This game has no online, poor graphics and limited minigames, three very big cons for me. I would recommend buying NBA Live 2006, which has online and franchise, but I don't own it yet."
890,1,"I'm sorry, but...","...I've seen too much damage come out of the trumped-up ritual abuse hysteria of the '80s/'90s. Thank God (yes, I'm a Christian), that this mostly-imagined phenomenon is no longer ""happening."" This book, while well-intentioned, is not based in reality."
891,1,Ida B. Wells: Woman of Courage,"I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money."
892,2,CDs DO NOT HAVE SOFTWARE!!!!!,It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form
893,4,"This is a perfect review book, but it is not a textbook.","If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit."
894,1,Terrible,"I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
895,5,I loved this book,"I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner."
896,5,Bryanna is brilliant!,"Once again, Bryanna has written a book that inspires everyone to eat well - by ""well"" I mean both healthfully and with gusto. Fantastic vegan fare."
897,1,DECEPCIONADO,"Me encanta leer libros de cocina y pense que este sería ""el libro"" para conocer arte y costumbres culinarias de otros paises. Como soy originario de México y ahora vivo en Brasil, lo primero que leí fue lo referente a estoa paises. QUE DECEPCIÓN!La idea del libro es excelente y seguramente la autora tuvo que viajar, leer y estudiar mucho, pero pienso que debió haber pedido ayuda a que revisaran sus capítulos personas conocedoras de cada país o región.Tiene muchos errores históricos, geográficos, culinarios y de ortografía del idioma original. Estoy preparando una lista de ellos que posteriormente enviaré.La felicito por su dedicación, perodes graciadamente el resultado no es del todo bueno.Hans Rio de Janeiro/Brasil"
898,4,The need for speead it's push you to add more memory!!!!,"This is a product wich can give you satisfaction running your computer! I'ts much faster then other products and can sure you the 'light speed' in xomputers world. I'ts compatible with most desktop configuration's : home computer's, office computer's... This is a product for men wich need speed."
899,1,This Is Not a Live Concert,Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals. What was one of the best concert videos that I had ever seen and heard was ruined by someone who thought he could improve on perfection. Don't waste your money if you've seen the original.
900,5,I would give it 10 stars if possible!!!,Whenever Tina Turner kicks off another world tour we know that one year later we can buy a great Live video!!! Live in Amsterdam is by far her best concert video ever! Tina Turner will start a new world tour early 2000...I can't wait to see her live again and by 2001 we will have another concert video as a fond reminder.
901,5,Review of Tina Truner's Wildest Dreams Tour,"Great DVD. If you are a Tina Turner fan, it's a must have."
902,1,big words used for big words sake,I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others.
903,2,this book is SO BORING,"sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars."
904,3,So-So,Sansa is my fav but it always shuts down on me and after six months it just breaks. Not good long term project but very easy to use and a decent price.
905,1,sent two back,IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW. THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON. THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE!!
906,3,Connectivity issues with otherwise good player.,"I purchased this mp3 player for my son. We were both very pleased with its functionality, ease of use, and sleek look. Unfortunately, either the player itself or the cable that came with it was defective, causing power errors, and keeping us from charging the unit or transferring data."
907,1,Malfunction and battery doesn't last long,"Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
908,1,Hate this thing,"I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed."
909,2,Its a Cheap MP3 Player thats it,"Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap."
910,5,Works Great,This MP3 player is so nice compared to the iPod. All you have to do is click and drag the music on your computer to the MP3 player. No iTunes required. It is very nice. The capacity of 8GB is very nice too.
911,3,OK but not GREAT,"The Sansa View 8G MP3 player is a great sounding player but it stops working from time to time and then when using on an excersize machine you must stop and reset which takes a few seconds. After reading other reviews their must be some kind of flaw in this product.I've had this for about a month and their is a 90 day warranty so I am not yet worried. If it stops working after the warranty I,ll suck it up and buy a different brand."
912,1,Save up and get a nano instead.,"Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
913,1,Battery problems,Worked fine... until the battery died after one year. You can't replace it so essentially the player is useless. Would not recommend.
914,1,"Less then one year, Issues already","I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
915,4,"Buy new, not refurbished","The player, itself, is great. You can drag and drop music easily without the need for another program. This is my 2nd one because the first one I bought (refurbished) constantly froze and the headphone jack began failing. If you want a big enough MP3 player for cheap, get this one, and buy some better headphones too."
916,5,Tops,This is a great product Be sure if you are getting a Sansa that it has the dial on the front. I have 3 sansa's and the only one I hate is the TOUCH Screen one. This one has so many great features and is so easy to use
917,1,Plzz don't buy it,"Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :["
918,1,"Great at First, but......","My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift. About a month ago it just stopped working. We have had several emails and phone calls back and forth to the company, ""Creative"" is an accurate name for them...they are creative about honoring the 90 day warranty by putting you off until you are out of warranty. They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced...and nothing yet. I emailed the company again today. They do not have a customer service number that is toll free, and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so, but now, I will never buy another ""Creative"" product again, based on their customer service."
919,1,Creative Rhomba = Big Headache,"After carefully opening the player, reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter, the player froze up. I can not accurately describe my anger. I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly. If it didn't cost me $125, I would have run it over with my car. Do yourself a favor, avoid the Rhomba at all costs."
920,1,"Don't buy this Product !!!!,","read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet. Dealing with their customer support is hell. remember I warned you ""Dont buy this product"""
921,3,Uninspired Examination of a Monuemental Life,"Looking for a biography of the former slave turned lecturer and abolitionist, I came across this work by author McFeely. The first section regarding the birth and circumstances of Douglass' flight to freedom was full of what I consider ""psychobabble"". The author makes too many conjectures concerning the relationship of Douglass with his owner, including possible latent homosexual feelings but never includes any information to back this claim up. The story picks up when Douglass moves to New England and becomes involved in the abolistionist causes. His travels to England and his relationship with women working for the cause of women's suffrage is particularly interesting. However, the remainder of the book seems to meander with no purpose.I am still searching for a biography which puts this man's life into context."
922,1,"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read, Don't Waste Your Time","I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
923,4,More Great Performances,"""The Old Grey Whistle Test Vol 1"" is the favorite music DVD in my collection. Volume II offers up more of the same type of intimate performances that this show was famous for. Unlike many shows of this nature, particularly those in the US, Whistle Test focused completely on the music. It was substance over style, though the dress favored by some of the acts looks hilarious now. Start with Volume 1 and then like me, you're going to want the second and third volumes. I hope there's more of these editions in the pipeline."
924,5,Recipes so easy the kids can help!,I am a single mom with two kids to feed and a boss that thinks I should work 50 hours a week just like the guys. This book lets me feed my family hot delicious meals no matter how late we get home or how much we have to do. And the recipes are so easy the kids can help. It is also great for those weeks when I do not have the kids and have to cook for one. I could pop in a Lean Cuisine or make pasta yet again but this book has many ideas more creative than that. It has reasonable portions for single servings and I can take any leftovers for lunch. It is a bargain.
925,5,What took me so long?!,"Why did I wait so long to get this book I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography....and easy to make your dish look like the photo!"
926,1,WHAT is the point of this show???,"Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."
927,4,Help for the holidays,"With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year."
928,1,Disappointing,The music plays just fine but the on screen picture is horrible. The picture is blurry and it looks like graphics form the 60's.
929,5,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN TRUE CRIME!! RIVETING!!,"Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."
930,4,MOTIVE,Bugliosi was without doubt a great prosecutor but the whole Helter Skelter theory as the motive over the years has become discredited in fact im not convinced Bugliosi if he tried the case today would use that idea again.
931,5,I could not stop reading it,"I began reading the paper book. I found it so amazing that it was hard for me to leave it for my daily activities. So I went to the beach with the intention to finish reading it. unfortunately, night came and I had to pick my tings up. I forgot to get my book back, so I bougth the Kindle version, which has some advantages."
932,3,This review is for the KINDLE edition,"Let me just say that this is a great book, however buy the print edition. There is a list of illustrations in the Kindle edition, but I've yet to find an actual illustration. The FOOTNOTES are grouped together in the back. Not helpful in understanding California law and police procedures in the late 60s. I feel like I bought half a book.Again, read this book, it's great, but get it in print.Hey Amazon! If you had mentioned these things in the description, I could have made a better choice. Please, please make these things clear from the beginning. It's my first Kindle disappointment, so I'm not bitter, just sad."
933,1,Helter Smelter,"Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?"
934,4,Informative Book,"This was a very informative (and at times, scary) book on the Manson murders. It is written by the prosecutor of the case, Vincent Bugliosi. I had only very limited knowledge of the case so reading this book really gave me some futher insight. I am not sure how much ""new"" information this book may provide someone who is well versed in this case.The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars is simply because it did drag at certain times but as a whole, this is a very well written book!"
935,2,This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!,"This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."
936,3,a very Catholic translation,"Although Mishima is one of my favorite authors I am having difficulty getting through this work, largely because of the terminology the translator has used. An otherwise excellent translation is marred by an appalling lack of understanding of Buddhism. Throughout the text on finds terms such as ""scripture"", ""priest"", ""parishioner"", and ""mass"" -- as if the subject were Roman Catholicism. This kind of metaphor reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the practice of Buddhism, which is annoying to this reader and would be misleading to others."
937,4,A Good Book,"This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author."
938,3,It kept my interest,"This isn't my usual type of novel, and I probably will move on to other authors. An earlier reviewer commented on the similarities to Dostojevski, and in retrospect, I agree, especially when recalling a scene involving a non-Dostojevski book entitled nevertheless, ""Crime and Punishment"" near the end of the novel. The novel shares some similarities with that of FD. The book is serious and well written, and will have appeal to some readers. I recently toured Tokyo and the nearby temples at Kamakura. That trip enhanced this novel very much for me. I've much to learn about Japanese culture and Buddhism; reading this novel was an enjoyable step in that direction. That said, relative to my favorite tasty Western novels, for me, this represented a kind of bland oatmeal: it was sturdy and good, but somehow lacking. Another reviewer noted the Catholic projection of the translator onto elements of Buddhism; I too found this distracting in the translation."
939,2,"Not new ,disappointed",I was surprised to see that the item was used. Advertised as new. Would have liked the new ones stead got used.
940,2,Too wordy....,I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book. I burst out in laughter in a couple of places but it was too little. I could see what the authors were trying to do but it was not enuf.. I liked the strangler book.
941,1,"Poor Design, Construction & Quality","We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again."
942,1,Not worth the $2.99,"I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking."
943,1,Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.,"I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone."
944,4,Very Comfy,"I really like these. I like that there are 3 different sizes for each ear. I use the small ones and my husband uses the large ones. It was like they were made just for my ears. I would recommend these even for headphone, not just bluetooth headsets."
945,1,POOR,GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.
946,3,It will be yellow after some months. It's just an eargel don't expect anymore,"If you are planning to buy it, I can guess you have bought an ""extraordinary"" Jawbone. I don't know if Jabra and Jawbone are a society but it is the only one option you have to get the handsfree in your ear.I think there are several ways you can use this gel to keep your headphones comfortable in your ear, however it has to be perfectly round and inch of diameter and no more than five milimeters of depth.If you are planning to buy them because you are planning to use it with a ""wonderful"" Jawbone, please consider other market options for BT handsfree.However if you have a very unconfortable and little headphones or an already bought Jawbone, it would be your unique solution. But maybe you won't ever need it if you look for a better BT handsfree device."
947,1,Jabra Ear Gels,"These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from. I sent mine back!"
948,1,Way too large!,"Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then."
949,2,Ear Gels,None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.
950,1,Don't waste your money,"They look cheep and feel cheep and well.. they are cheep but they don't work which is the bottom line. Fitting them onto the jawbone does not lock into place so the ear piece you just spent over a 100bucks for falls out of your ear! It's not worth it since Jawbone gives you five ear buds that lock onto the Jawbone, which fit your snugly in your ear. They also give you a left ear or a right ear bar that lets you choose which works for you. So this product fails and had I'd seen them in person I wouldn't have spent my money on them."
951,2,pain in the ear,"They feel better than the jawbone junk but there is no perfect fit even though they give you several different sizes. Then the jawbone bluetooth falls out of most of them.Basically, a waste of money unless you are one of the lucky ones that all fits as you had hoped."
952,1,not compatable with the jawbone.,produce is not compatable with the jawbone. design does not provide a snug fit to the bluetooth unit. a waste of money
953,2,"They fit nicely in the ear, but don't work so well with jawbone","I have to say these earbuds do fit very snuggly in the ear and great a great feeling. Unfortunately I bought them for the jawbone 2. After about 3 weeks of using the same earbud on the jawbone, the earbud would not stay on the jawbone. It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now."
954,2,Far from perfect...,"I had high hopes for these to make my new Jawbone Era usable.Unfortunately, they are hard to fit, are not as flexible or form fitting as I had hoped and overall could stand to be much improved.Buy them if you have no other choice, but don't expect much or you'll be disappointed."
955,2,These don't work with Jabra BT250v headsets,"I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine."
956,1,Ripoff ! Don't Buy From CMMA Accessories !,"I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund. Their shipping costs are 6 times what it cost me to return them for no refund. Amazon, where are you to remove CMMA Accessories ? Don't let their 3 or 4 star overall rating fool you !"
957,5,Awesome,"This movie was great! It combioned old Greek and Roman tales in today's special effects and Vwala! AWESOME! This tale is a romance about a man who leaves on a journey right after a new born son to go through the God of Athena right down to the underworld only to go back to his wife and live happily ever after, A WONDERFUL MOVIE! I recommend it to anyone who likes olden tales."
958,4,Wow,"I think The Odyssey by Homer is a pretty good movie. The cast members look like they lived in that time period. Some of the people that played in the movie are (Armand Assante) Odysseus, (Greta Sacchi) Penelope, (Isabella Rosselini) Athene, and many more. Also the clothes they wore were authentic. Like the tunic, all the dresses, and the armor. The casting by the actors made you think that you were watching the real thing. My favorite character in the movie is Michael Pollard who played Aeolus the god of wind. During the movie they started new adventures as soon as the finished one. The movie is pretty good but is slow in some parts. After a slow part it picked back up into an action scene. It is also more historical than entertainment. They had to press the wine, sacrifice goats, heard goats, fish, make weapons, and several other things. So in conclusion I give The Odyssey four stars"
959,4,kewl!,"The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking."
960,3,A well done movie,"The movie ""The Odyssey"" was well done. It was much betterthan the movie Ulysses. The movie Ulysses didn't really tell EXACTLY what happened. But, However as a result The Odyssesy was FOUR to FIVE HOURS! It may be long but the actors did well memorizing their lines. So I recommend that you shoud start this movie somwhere between Daylight and the afternoon."
961,4,Where's the soundtrack?,"I loved this movie/mini series. I've watched it time and again. I've always wondered about the soundtrack..I just CANNOT find it anywhere. (There is a link on amazon music..waiting for the seller to respond if what he/she has is the real thing) If anyone knows where to get the soundtrack, pls do send me a mail.ThanksChet"
962,2,NOT a good representation of Homer,"I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."
963,1,OMG! worst movie ever!,"haha . . . wow this is one of those movies that is so completly bad that its funny. ok 1st of all Odysseus accent changes in almost every scene. 2nd penelope pronounces telemachos different than Odysseus. 3rd telemachos sounds like a whiney english boy. 4th posiedon ""the god of the wine dark sea"" is a face in a wave. 5th anitkleia is just freaky. 6th Odysseus beard changes color. 7th the cow scene wasnt even in there. 8th THEY NEVER LET PENELOPE HAVE HER REVENGE! 9th telemachos cant do any thing but then amazingly he can throw 2 spears at once. 10th Aoilos sounds like a cartoon. 11th the characters are all supposed to be bueatiful but they are all ugly . . . and i can go on. NOTEBOOMS 1/2 ROX! haha SPACE NEEDLE!"
964,1,Very BORING,"This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see."
965,1,dont buy from them,"They sent the wrong part, its been 21 days and not resolved. Thier 1-800 # will not let you talk to any one. I left messages and no response. I real close to file a complaint with the BBB. Dont buy.LB"
966,4,PSALMS NOW,"Great book for reading Psalms in our times. It uses words and phrases which make some of them very pertinent to today. If read in conjunction with reading the same verses in the Bible, it opens up new thoughts. Especially the 23rd Psalm."
967,4,rated comparatively with Wilbur's others,"i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore."
968,4,"Early Wilbur Smith, prelude of great things to come.","This novel was written over 30 years ago. It is not as polished as his newer books but it contains all the elements that make Smith one of the masters of action and adventure. Exotic locale, unforgettable characters and a prose that takes you `there'.Let Wilbur take you to a trip to Africa, you will be coming back for more."
969,1,The Diamaond Hunters,"When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth."
970,4,Abridged Ahab?,"I prefer this update to the Gregory Peck version, although I could wish it had been more faithful to the original book. My question is this: the original television special was 4 HOURS LONG. Even allowing for commercial time, there had to have been at least 3 hours of film. Now, the running time of the DVD is 2hrs 25 minutes, and the video is even shorter; What happened to the rest of the material?!"
971,1,1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles,So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.
972,5,Classic epic film,The classic epic film adaptation of a great story of good vs. evil. A real nailbighter.
973,1,I Don't Think So!,"Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did."
974,2,strong smell of oil,This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.
975,1,Poor Product,"This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours."
976,1,review by Tarek musslimani,This is an absolutely not useful book. It is not understood at all and it is written so that no body can understand it but the author himself. So I do not recommend for you to buy it. Please save your money.TM
977,4,A corded mouse that really works.,"It is everything I want and need. The cord length is generous. And, because it is corded, the performance is reliable and greater than a wireless mouse. Additionally, because it is corded it does not require batteries.I give the quality 5 stars because, it was a problem fee(plug and play)install and its precise tracking.I am happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others."
978,3,Great Read!,I started reading Ann Perry's Pitt series in 2005. It's a good read. The Pitts are safe. The Monk's series is dark and intriguing. I love Monk! He is so courageous and does what it takes to get the truth. I hope Perry allows him to get his full memory or at least 80% back.
979,3,Not what I expected.,"Old school Van Damme. It's a fun watch, but he's the bad guy which means that he doesn't get a whole heck-uva-lot of screen time. If you want a good old school Van Dammage stick with ""Blood Sport"""
980,1,create your own flea circus,"I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk. He claimed he had over 20 ferrets and at one time had a flea problem. I vacuumed, sent the dog to the groomers for a flea dip, then came home and sprayed the entire house. I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief. Forget the claim that it keeps on acting for up to 7 mos. I am not infested with fleas, but we still have them.....and they are alive and well."
981,4,Punk Meets Venom,"Hallows Eve are often overlooked and they were one of the more interesting metal bands to emerge in the early-mid 80's. Not really consisdered thrash in the truest sense they were more equal parts Venom(Death Metal) and Hardcore Punk probably drawing from some of the anarchist bands of the time (Ie-Crucifix). Remember this came out in 85 and very few bands other than Venom, Celtic Frost and the thrash faction of punk (ie: DRI)were doing anything this extreme. Highly recommended."
982,4,Peyton Plantation,"In the years when my friends were sneaking peeks at ""Peyton Place"", I was secretly devouring ""The Foxes of Harrow"". This was after seeing the B-movie version starring Rex Harrison and Maureen O'Hara. To me it was every bit as good as ""Gone With the Wind"" and has stuck with me lo these many years. FYI, Frank Yerby had his picture on the jacket of my aunt's Book Club edition, quite interesting for that time, as other readers have pointed out."
983,2,Disappointing,"Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy."
984,5,Heart Warming,"Diane Lane is great is this nicely crafted story set in the beautiful Tuscan country side. After watching the DVD extra's where the director talked about how it rained the entire time they filmed this in Italy I had to go back and watch it again - what a great job disguisung bad weather.This is just a nice story with no bad language, no violence and lots of gorgeous scenery."
985,5,Stunning masterpiece and great fun.,"I loved this film so much. It is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen and the acting by Diane Lane was incrdeible. The scenery was fabulous and the movie is infused with fun, comedy and drama. A great movie. A stunning masterpiece of the genre. 5 stars."
986,1,I hope Frances Mayes Got A Lot of Money for the Rights...,"I love her books so much! This movie is an absolute insult! The original story was so wonderful I can't understand why the film makers thought they were making something better. And Ed! What about Ed? Geez. I could only get through the part where they were taking out the wall between the two rooms, foolishly thinking that the movie would get better, and after that I was done. Another good thing about DVDs is that you don't have to be kind and rewind. It would have be a waste of electricity and my VCR. This movie is right up there with Ishtar! Except worse!"
987,1,Stinks,This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!
988,2,Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.,"Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book."
989,4,entertaining movie.,This movie was well paced and entertaining. The actors were good and the setting and great. Good chic or couples movie.
990,3,Lovely View but Disappointing Story,"Although the movie offers stunning cinematography, and a rich travelogue view of Tuscany, the story disappoints. Diane Lane, ever the remarkable actress, portrays a woman who finds herself still empty and lonely, no matter how much adventure she has taken on and no matter how much she accomplishes after setback and heartbreak. If she doesn't find herself another man and a live-in permanent lover, everything is for nought. ..."
991,5,my favorite movie ever,"Okay, I am a sucker for traveling, adventure, love stories, good wine and well, Italian trees too. After watching this film, you'll have an attitute like why not and move to Italy, buy a house, fill it up with people, make them your family... This movie gives a good life perspective to thouse who are found at some kind of dead end. It is kind of like an ice breaker of our society. Portrays very well how many people can live in darkness not realize that happiness is just within reaching of hand. Just like the character of the story, stuck in San Fransisco, mild town, with grey streets and boring, busy people, who only mind their own business. She is dipressed...not until she goes to Italy and radically changes her life by making a sudden choice that most people in San Fransisco would name mad!"
992,4,A Very Pleasant Story,Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.
993,4,Quite a change from the book,"Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume."
994,2,Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot,"Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?"
995,5,Great movie for you and your gal friends to watch together!,Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!
996,3,OMG Raoul Bova,"Only worth it for the Italian actor Raoul Bova who gives life to Marcello, who has a love affair with Frances. Like it's every day that you escape from your boring life and dull husband to encounter a man as gorgeous as this one in a faraway country, huh! Bova must be the most beautiful man on earth."
997,2,Ho-Hum,"One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!"
998,2,Cute but typical,"So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically ""chick-flick"" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."
999,5,Good scenery!,"Ok, the story may be a little slow and unrealistic and all that, but I actually enjoyed it. Movies that are slow-paced without containing violence or a murder du jour are refreshing in this day and age. Plus the scenery can't be beat. Debbie Farmer, syndicated parenting author of,'Don't Put Lipstick on the Cat'"
1000,2,A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE',"Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative. Lets just say that if you want to see Diane Lane at her best, Unfaithful is a better bet.If you enjoy film that insults your intellect while shooting pretty scenes country side, then by all means enjoy!"
1001,2,IS OK...I GUESS,"THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN. SAW IT ONCE DONT CARE TO SEE IT AGAIN. MY OPINION OF COURSE."
1002,4,Not Bad...for a chick flick,"Interesting!! This film takes place in Italy and surrounds itself with a character who recently gets divorced, and finds herself, at the urging of her friends (who happen to be gay) to get away from it all and take sometime to herself...little do they all know (including her) that she ends up going out there, and never coming back to the States to live. This is a story of a woman who is looking for more in life than just the normal basic stuff. She wants to live her life to the fullest and really enjoy what the world has to offer her. Good film, great message for all!!"
1003,4,A light comedy,"Diana Lane is perfect in this role. She owns a cosmical beauty and it's extraordinary nice too.Since a winner executive but unhappy woman, decides to make a twist of fate in Toscana, she will experience a whole different conceptions about the love and the sense of the friendship. Her only truly fellows are two lesbians,the charming and always beloved Italia seduces her in many ways is obviously another incorporean actor in the screen.The homagge to La dolce vita is very smart clue in the sense you can be happy if you're really commited with will and constant desire.Share this one with your couple, fianceé or beloved girl or boy friend."
1004,4,Excellent,"I loved this movie. If a relationship falling apart is unrealistic, you can count yourself lucky. I thought it was very realistic. Moving to Italy can only be done with a lot of money,but if I had the dough, I'd have gone right after I saw UTS. It made me feel good, and I recommend it, as I have to other people.Plus Diane Lane is hot."
1005,4,A pleasant way to spend an evening,"Diane Ladd plays a woman who has just been unceremoniously dumped by her husband. In an attempt to cheer her up, her two friends offer her tickets to go to Tuscany. While she's there, she impulsively buys a villa and then wonders what she's gotten herself in for. She hires an eccentric group of Polish workers and sets about rebuilding the villa and her life. There are a few bumps along the way, but she finally succeeds. The scenery in this movie is breathtaking and it alone is worth the price of admission. There are times when the overacting is painful and there are several lapses in credibility but all in all it's a pleasant way to spend an evening."
1006,3,So so tale under the Italian landscape,"I loved the Italian landscape, and I think it was best aspect of the film. As for the plotline and the film itself, I'd have to say I was disappointed. With all the rave reviews about the film, and it's long cinema run, I guess I was looking for something more. This is one of those movies that will probably take a second showing in order to grow on me.Otherwise, it is worth viewing if you enjoy the theme of a woman who escapes, or should I say, runs away to beautiful Italy to live a somewhat carefree life that still does not allow her to escape disappointment and a slight experience of heartache with an Italian hunk! The ending did not leave me with that warm feeling."
1007,2,"Beautiful scenery, but thats about all","Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing."
1008,1,Canon NB-5L Battery Pack,"The battery I got has a terrible quality. With a full charge over night (~8 hours), the battery only sustained my SD800 IS camera less than 12 hours normal usage, shot around 20 pictures. Versus to the original battery pack with the camera, the original battery can last over two days normal usage, shot around > 100 pictures. I believe the vendor selling degraded products."
1009,1,"OMG, a complete waste of time","Having read the novella Rollerball prior to the first version being made, and having seen that one on the big screen, I awaited the remake. It came & went big screen in near record time. That should have been warning enough. Unfortunately I rented this piece of **** and even worse, I watched the whole thing. All the time thinking, it can't be this bad, it has got to get better. It is that bad, and it never got better. Other than the title, and some aspects of the game, nothing in common witht he original book. Very little in common with the first movie. James Caan vs. who ever he was. No contest Caan. Even Jean Reno is wasted in this mess. Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorlly shot, poorly edited. And loud, I mean Loud, you know LOUD. I really wanted to give this zero stars, but that was not an option."
1010,1,A Total Failure,"If you've seen the original Rollerball staring James Caan, then you'll probably want to give this remake a miss. It is no longer set in a future controlled by corporations, it is set in the near present which is pretty much like reality. The hero doesn't hold a candle to James Caan.It does have plenty of action, if mindless action is to your taste. The rollerball arena is poorly designed which makes following the action difficult at times. The villiam is just another greedy businessman/crook with nothing to make him stand out from a 1000 other businessman/crooks in other movies.My adive? Save your money and get a copy of the original Rollerball."
1011,1,ZERO stars... OMG I can't believe I even bothered to finish this thing.,"I wish I had read the reviews. As it is I distroyed the copy of the tape I had so that won't inflict damage on anyone else. (In an evironmentally friendly way of course).The original Roller ball was pretty bad, and the remake is worse if that were possible. In a fit of weakness I put the tape in the machine and let it play. I kept thinking, this can't get any worse and then it did. <repeat> And then thank god it was over.If I could sue for the return of my 2hrs of veiwing time I would."
1012,2,Design confuses some into burning kettle,"I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source)."
1013,4,criminally under rated doom metal!,these guys were the cream of the doom metal crop late 80s/early 90s.melodically heavy and great musicanship they are very black sabbath insired and can definetly pick up the pace and move.thi live cd is recorded very well and candlemass was in rare form for these recording.get a piece of history buy this cd.
1014,3,Ask yourself: is it worth it?,"I wouldn't get this unless you are completley gaga over BESD. He is expensive for all he is. I suggest buying something more fun with your 30 bucks. Perhaps Zoid's Energy Liger! You'd have a lot of money left over, and he's worth it!My final comment: don't get this unless you are really serious."
1015,2,One of my favorite toys!,This Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is awesome! I got it for Christmas and I played with it all day. The one I got came with the card Shadow Spell. It's a cool toy so if you can't find anything at Toys 'R' Us or somthing buy this!
1016,2,"So much potential, but one overwhelming problem","On paper, this recorder seemed to be perfect for my needs - primarily scheduled recordings of TV programs. In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit ""to make some sound"" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket. If I could have disabled the TV Guide, I would have kept the unit and programmed it manually.I reluctantly returned the recorder."
1017,1,Engineering gone bad,"I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS.It's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. They last about 2 months(or less), after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own. My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it. The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit cannot even be purchased on -line at any web site anymore. This is sad after only a few months on the market. I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer."
1018,2,Very disappointed,"Although these sheets are pretty and warm, their size and fit are horrible. The fitted bottom sheet is far too long plus the elastic around the corners is not tight enough to keep the sheet on the mattress (which tends to come off through the night). And the flat sheet is barely wide enough. I would not buy these again."
1019,2,Shrinkage,"These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."
1020,1,bad,"got a different pattern and the dye fades on everything even me, even after 5 washings do nor waist your money"
1021,4,My wife loves them!,"Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale."
1022,4,"""Kid, I don't care what you do...""","A guilty -- but perhaps not all that guilty -- pleasure. A small comedic indie made by Brian De Palma way back in hisGreetingsandHi, Mom!days, it still retains a charming, if somewhat adolescent, absurdism. Tommy Smothers plays a corporate dropout in a loveless relationship who yearns to become a tap-dancing magician, taught by none other than Orson Welles's Mr. Delasandro in full pretentious mentoring mode. Add Katherine Ross as the adoring new girlfriend, Allan Garfield as a brassiere maker in search of his perfect woman, and especially the wonderful John Astin as a laid off executive-turned-derelict-turned-executive and you have the sort of bizarre, off-kilter type of fun movie you would have seen as a college student at a midnight showing in theaters during the late 60's/early 70's. Innocently subversive.And can any movie that bills (correctly) an early Katherine Ross as ""Terrific-Looking Girl"" be all that bad?"
1023,1,JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,wow I had the exact same things happen to the one I got for my kid bad motion sensor and bad display. he wanted it so much we tried returning it twice after the third one didn't work even my six year old said forget it. I wish i could have given it a black hole instead of 1 star. JUNK!!!!!!!!
1024,4,"For the price, very reasonable!","The product was exactly as I had expected, and came quickly. I had to buy two for an expo, not knowing of they would of satisfactory quality, but fortunately, they were professional looking enough and did the trick.Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase."
1025,4,"Good, but not great","You know, I read this ine, and I did like it- a lot- but it didn't crack me up like _Lords and Ladies_. This really is a funny book, as humorous fiction goes, but against my Pratchett standards, it doesn't quite measure u"
1026,5,Small Gods - Terry Pratchett,"A lovely story, exposing the underbelly of religion amusingly and, in the final section, reverentially - the ending brings tears to my eyes."
1027,2,Missing pages in ebook,"I'm a late comer to Terry Pratchett but have utterly gotten caught up in the world he's created and the incredibly intelligent books. While I greatly enjoy the book itself, I was highly disappointed with the ebook because it is missing numerous pages in the version for the iphone. Unfortunately I passed the deadline for a return. Missing one or two pages is not appropriate but not a big deal. There were at least 4 places that were missing 4-6 pages in the iphone version."
1028,5,Native American Project,My kid found this very helpful for a school project. Another student in her class had the book and she wanted her own corp.
1029,5,the best of,"this cd collects some of the best metal massacre. whether it is fantasy ,etal or death and thrash it is all here. buy it!!"
1030,3,"OK overall, though fabric is thin.","The fabric is thin, and therefore, when light shines through it, the toile design is not really visible. My plan is to buy some off-white fabric and sew it on as backing."
1031,1,Measurements????,"Since I can't get Babies R Us to write me back, I thought I'd try this. What are the measurements of this valance? Length? Width? Anyone who can offer this information would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you!"
1032,1,cross contamination,"The many ideas given (eat the inside of sandwiches, eat the top off of canapes, avoid the crust) can give a true celiac serious consequences. Sometimes, a person can eat gluten with no obvious side effects but do great ""silent damage"" to one's intestines. There are complications to celiac disease such as refractory sprue and collagenous sprue. I have these complications due to not being strict enough when following the gluten free diet."
1033,1,The Gluten-Free Bible,"There are serious inaccuracies in this book that can cause a great deal of stress for a celiac. The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster. Finally, her flip advice about how to avoid answering questions is ridiculous. Why not be honest instead of avoiding the questions. It's up to the person as to how many details they want to give. But avoiding the issue is not the answer."
1034,1,"Great attitude, if only the info was great...","Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free."
1035,1,Irresponsible!,"What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"
1036,1,Socialite celiac,"Although this book had good information, it had to be ferreted out. It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children. She had a snit because the hostess did not cater to her every whim. She demonstrated rude behavior that I would not have tolerated.I would have prefered she give me good information on common occurances on living the 'real' life."
1037,3,Thomas Ince's Antiwar Epic,"Released shortly before America entered World War I, producer Thomas Ince's ""Civilization"" (1916) was an ambitious, partially successful attempt to match the artistry and scale of D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation."" By incorporating religious symbolism with social commentary, Ince and director Raymond West crafted a film that struck a responsive chord with the audiences of its day. However, once America became involved in the war, ""Civilization"" was withdrawn from circulation. Despite its historic significance, Ince's pacifist epic languished in obscurity until recent years. Though marred by weak acting and dated melodrama, the picture remains of historic interest for its antiwar sentiments and religious message. ""Civilization"" did not prevent America from going to war, but it did help the country find a spiritual and moral unity during that turbulent period."
1038,4,"Good strong basket, but no instructions","I use this to carry some heavy groceries, and I haven't had any troubles yet. The quality is good, and it's very strong and durable. It's a little dorky looking, but gets the job done. It came with absolutely no instructions, and I called the company and they faxed them to me. It was somewhat tricky to attach to my bike, but that's probably more because of my lack of skills.I'd definitely recommend it, especially if you're going to carry heavy things."
1039,5,Good choice for anyones needs ..,This was a good choice...good quality..Great price too...My husband had a Problem attaching it to the bike only b-cause he had the bike fork on backwards on the Ladies Bike ....we received the basket abt. a week after we ordered it...even though it said 4-6 weeks...happy with that too !!
1040,4,Worth buying?,"I really loved this album. It has good lyrics and wonderful messages. Don't know if you have the same taste as me? I also love Jaci Velasquez, Clear, and DC Talk. It is definitely worth the 12 bucks."
1041,1,Don't waste your time or money,"This CD is very much UNLIKE step 2. I don't know who wrote the questions on this program, but they clearly were not familiar with usmle format or usmle content. In agreement with the other reviews, the questions were totally random and kind of off the wall. If they have the audacity to charge 59.00, they should at least live up to the price tag. You are better off using the practice CD that USMLE gives you for free."
1042,3,Nasty.................,This goes back to basic METAL. When METAL RULED THE WORLD!!!!!!!! Pick it up its worth the price.......
1043,3,"Richard takes on the ""Top 40""","Another early '70s studio departure for Richard - in a production yielding almost nothing like his dynamic stage shows of the era. On 4-5 cuts, he sings like there's no tomorrow: Brown Sugar, Born On The Bayou, and a new song, co-written by Producer H. B. Barnum, Green Power, undoubtedly one his greatest recordings, vocally, and in relevance to the times. He adds a rare touch of irony to the proceedings, which will surprise even the most ardent worshippers.No acoustic piano heard at all; obstrusive lady chorus getting in Richards' way and in the way of the band. On the few tracks where they are properly mixed, however, they sound fine.Great title tune which was played like a single at the time - in the mood and structure of many '50s reflections, it coulda/shoulda been released as a 45 rpm...then Little Richard would have had another Top 40 hit for himself."
1044,2,Soot-covered Sentimentality,"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping ""Germinal"". For the best critique of Dickens, read ""Against Nature"" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."
1045,3,Still Hard Times,"This book isn't Oliver Twist. This book reminds me of Animal Farm, only not as comical, but the social commentary is the same. What would the world be like if children were raised without that magical sense of wonder and pretend? What was the world like before the working class was not respected for all the hard work they do? Those definately would be hard times. This is just the scenario in this book. In this book, Coketown is a hard place. The factory workers toil day in and day out yet get no respect from ""civilized society"". Louisa and Thomas Gradgrind are raised with books and facts and no room in the world for emotion, and then Sissy, a carnie orphan, enters their world as each spiral in different directions due to their upbringing. What happens? Hard times indeed but in the end, the human spirit triumphs even if not everyone gets to see that wonderful ending."
1046,1,"Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written","This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."
1047,2,Zzzzzzz,"I found Hard Times to be a particularly boring novel. I also purchased the matching audiobook which I listened to on a long drive. There should be a warning label! The darn thing puts you to sleep faster than listening to Stephen Hawking all day...anesthetized! Why not one star? I like Dickens, what can I say?"
1048,4,Better then the last.,It had more challenges and characters then the 1st Maximum Impact. The original Japanese language makes it better for the fans of the series.
1049,5,Real ...,"This ... is keepin it real. He got something to smoke to, somethin to ride to, something to get yo freak on to. It's an all around good cd. I can listen to it several times in a row and everytime I rehear a song - I feel it like it was the first time I heard it. Of course big snoop helps keep it bossed up.YOU GOTZ TA DO IT!!!!!"
1050,3,battles,every time i try shaking it for like 2 hours i just wont get me into a battle i have had this toy for 1 yr. and yet no battle but it is still a really realy good toy
1051,1,are you kidding me?,"I have 2 boys and several nephews. I know about and buy a lot of toys for boys. This is by far the biggest piece of junk that I have come across in a long time. The graphics- very poor. The overall ease of use and entertainment value- also very poor. This reminds me of the ""electronic"" happy meal games. I bought two PETs and both were defective and had to be returned to the store. The PET launches into battle mode via a motion sensor which is activated when you shake the PET. Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."
1052,5,This looks awesome!,"i have seen the reviews and commercial and this thing is so awsome! I cant wait to get mine this christmas! Why buy this? Because it pretty much brings the cartoon to life! Yes it may have Mr. Game and Watch grapics(if u know who he is) but overall this game is like the show! So the graphics come right back and hit you in the face because the graphics dont really matter. and one more thing....... this thing, this thing is awesome!"
1053,5,Anonymous,"I don't know why anyone would complain about this product. I got it for $30 and it works great. It DOES NOT play WMA for those of you wondering, but I have a program that converts WMA to MP3, so that's no problem for me. It was a little confusing figuring out how to program the FM radio, but I figured it out myself in about 5 minutes. If you're really having trouble you can look online at www.sonicblue.com/support. It gives you all the help you'll need. I'm not sure of how the battery life is other than what the product claims, no problems there. I've already got it hooked up in my car too, and it works in there. The picture makes it appear as if there really are only a few buttons, but the large circle has play/pause/on, forward, back, stop/off buttons that are all multifuncional as well as a special button that enables different play modes as well as the radio. It's not very complicated. So far I love this thing. Get one if they're still only $30"
1054,2,I just dont understand,"Maybe it is just me but this is some real crap. Dont get me wrong, I like black metal, and not just the symphonic stuff like Dimmu Borgir and later Emporer. This album i akin to someone pissing in my ear. There is almost no quality in the musicianship. Repetitive and just plain boring. If you want to hear REAL old-school but also excellent BM go and get Satyricon's The ShadowThrone and anything by Mayhem. Dont waste your time with this drivel. im not a kid either but beleive what you will."
1055,2,Anno Dracula Boring,"The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining. The characters were not believable and left me with wanting to many unanswered questions. The author took to many liberties with facts. All in all, I just didn't care for the book, skipped thru pages to end it so I could go on to more enjoyable reading. Amazon offers so many options and choices that I'm bound to pick a lemon once in awhile. I always read the brief description of the book before I buy but in this book that wasn't enough."
1056,1,Not worth your time!,"As of now I am completing drivers Ed. We take tests over this book, and I feel it is rather outdated for what it is being used for. The pictures are helpful, but the text I found boring and most of the text seemed just to be fill. They streched out simple procedures, and filled the usefull information with unimportant details. If you want to pass the test, read your state drivers manual. If you think this will help you, try it, but I warn you, its not worth it. Your state drivers manual is worth you time, check it out!"
1057,2,Politics?,"A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read."
1058,1,No Editor? Mediocre Content.,"After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future."
1059,2,Good ONLY for total beginner,I came away with literally nothing new from this book. If you have read many web forums or other books- this is aimed at complete newbies.I also didn't like the writing style or editing. If you know the very basics and don't want to be 'spoken' to like a 5yr old get Andy Stanford's excellent Surgical Speed Shooting.I am just not the target audience for this material.
1060,4,great book,"Great book on the order of combat handgunnery almost a dead copy of Massad ayoob combat handgunnery even a forward by Ayoob its ok it reads like all the rest of these type of books do, can you shoot someone, then on to well you are gonna be arrested if you do even if you are in the right, then a few brief words about outdated handguns and ammo. Almost a ringer for Massad ayoobs combat handgunnery try col jeff cooper and wiley clapp"
1061,3,Dated but still useful,This book would be excellent if it were updated. It contains a lot of useful info but needs to be brought up to the 21st century.
1062,5,Highly Recommended!,"There are many, many resources out there for those citizens that are considering carrying a weapon for personal or home defense. Many if not most of these have been written by current or former law enforcement officers and may contain tips and guidance that are not optimal for private citizens.This book is written by a private citizen who has attended extensive and exhaustive training from some of the best in the business, and is now offering his insight from ""the regular civilian"" perspective.I have read many books and periodicals on this subject over the past thirty years. I still learned quite a bit and had to rethink a number of ideas I had assimilated from other authors.In my opinion, this book is a mandatory addition to the reference shelf of any armed citizen."
1063,4,Armed Response,"This is a very good book for the person who plans to carry concealed firearms. The logic is clear and the recommendations are sound. Unfortunately, the proof reading is atrocious. In the early chapters paragraphs are repeated and there are other other problems. I lined out several sentences that were misplaced and had to tape in a loose page that came with the book. The book is sound and I would have given it a 5 if the proof reader had not messed it up."
1064,4,Great content...poor publishing,"The book by David Kenik has a lot of great points concerning self defense...however, in my copy, there were numerous paragraphs cut off at the end of the page, with no continuation on the following page...at least a half dozen or more (I'm trying to be coservative) instances of this happening. The content is very worthwhile. Just wish whoever printed the book would've taken greater care...esp. when the paperback book cost approx $16. If the same care was taken in self defense as in publishing, the fight would be one and done."
1065,3,A decent read...,"This book is good on structure and well organized for retention, with some very good points and very approachable examples and analogies. It is not a must read for everyone, and the insights provided are fairly straightforward. It moves pretty quickly and stays focused, so its worth your time if you feel that confrontations are a weakness."
1066,5,IF You Could Buy Only One Book,"I read this when it was first published and then bought it for each staff member as one of our required primers. I also gave one to each of my Board members. If there is one book I wish had existed 30 years ago, this is it."
1067,2,Not for me,"I thought that this might be interesting, but language was too old and I found it to be boring. I deleted it soon after."
1068,4,Overall Good Book,"Book was great and a nice read... but the cover was dirty, don't know why Amazon would sell a dirty book."
1069,4,Wonderful Teen Adventure in Alaska,"This is a strong message book - with the message being that even teenagers have to have moral character and live or die by their word. It's a story that is timeless, but is told like a folk tale, with country aphorisms and speckled with crusty old timers and real life problems. A good book for all ages, but particularly appealing to teenagers who should be able to relate to the problems of the teens in this story."
1070,1,Lousy Camera,"This is the first time I post a review because I am compelled to do so.I bought this camera to use during the Christmas holidays. I tried to use it the first time to take a picture of the Christmas tree, all I saw was complete darkness. Then I realized that I needed more light. So I turned on all the lights in the house and it was still darkness. If you plan to use this camera indoor, please forget about it! No way.It isn't that great outdoor neither. I took many pictures with the automatic exposure setting. It cannot handle anything with a bright background. It will just be VERY bright.I tried to use it on the ski slopes. I think it is because of the cold temperature, the camera has to be reset often. To make the matter worse, the pictures turned out literally ""twisted"".I can't belive a HP camera can have so many flaws. Very disappointing. Please don't buy one."
1071,1,Piece of junk,Camera is only usable outside in broad daylight. Trying anything inside your home/place of business and you'll have nothing but black on your screen.I am returning the product and will probably try lifeview camera with flash to see if camera aperture allows more light in.I was in rooms that were pretty well lit up...and viewfinder is dark as night.Should never have been released as a product because of these flaws...and it doesn't have to be this way. Laptop usb cameras offer incredibly bright pictures in low light conditions.
1072,3,Weird sound,Not a bad concert but the sound is uneven. I tried every permutation on my Yamaha DSP A-3090 processor to fix the problem but failed. I can't figure it out considering that this is a recent recording.
1073,2,Audio= Very Poor,First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed. The front speakers and center channel were OK. The rear was terrible. The overall audio quality was the worst I have heard. Listened to it once and went back the next day thinking my set up had to be wrong. Tried two other DVD's and both were fine. Suggest you try something else.
1074,2,poor sound mix on many of the tracks,"Great artists, great track listing, extremely poor audio mix... should have forgotton about the DTS as there was no 5 channel mix to speak of...actually made arrangements through Amazon to exchange mine for another copy as there were several flaws ar the end of all the sentences on the tracks by EJ, clapton and Paul. Unfortunately, these sound flaws ruined the experience but I'm hoping the replacement copy will be of better quality."
1075,3,Somewhat disappointing...,"It sort of felt like they mostly performed with the attitude that I'm doing this for free; I'm not putting any more into it than I have to. Mark Knopfler's performance was lackluster to say the least. The only one who really seemed to put their heart into it was Elton John. I can't say that I wasted my money, but it won't be the most listened to DVD on my shelf!"
1076,5,Excellent Concert,"A great concert. I found the sound to be excellent, the performances great, a must have. The percussionist by the way is Ray Cooper ( I think). He is excellent, very flamboyant and fun to watch; which is probably why he is shown so often."
1077,2,Disappointed with the sound quality,"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen. Some of the performances were disappointing: Mark Knoffler seemed to be drunk and/or on autopilot, Paul McCartney made my throat sore hearing him attempt to hit high notes that he can't quite manage anymore."
1078,5,Lens Cap,This lens cap works good. It is of good quality and fits my camera lens filter with no problem. I put it on my Canon SX40 with with this size adapter and filter.
1079,2,Disappointing - additional equipment needed,"We purchased this for use in a first-grade classroom. After reading the reviews and descriptions we ordered this tape. On receiving it we found that every participant needs a set of dumbbells and ankle weights. Nowhere did we see indications that additional additional equipment was needed. We are now deciding whether to return this tape unopened. Please be aware that this tape is of dubious benefit unless you have access to dumbbells (the bar-bell type, not the student type) and ankle weights."
1080,3,"Overall, a good book, but something still seems missing....","At the end of the book, the author stresses how the purpose of the book was to focus on the victims, rather than the sensationalism of the crime. Yet, throughout the book, I found very little to help me to connect to the victims, whom I'm sure were wonderful girls. I think the book would have reached me more deeply had it been written from the first person voice, rather than the author referring to herself in the third person. I also wonder about her insights on scenes during which she was not present. Nevertheless, the book touched me and I pray for the victims and the families involved. I believe her portrayal of the media was right on target."
1081,5,A families point of view,"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these ""mystery 4 men"". I was glad to hear a book had been written from ""their"" point of view. When I say ""their"" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."
1082,5,Works Great,No loss in audio quality and I'm no longer tied to the computer. This cord is so long I can get up and go get my coffee without disconnecting.
1083,2,poor fit ruins sound - avoid this product,"Product arrived promptly and in good condition. However, the female jack does not fit properly with my headphones. If you insert the male headphone plug fully into this cable, the sound is hollow and nearly silent. If you fiddle with the connection and pull the headphone plug out slightly, the sound is great. Getting it right is a pain and will probably increase wear and tear on the connectors. I'm looking for another productNote: this is result was achieved with Bose MIE2 earbuds (with iphone controls). The earbuds are top quality and have given me no trouble with other products/accessories, so this cable is definitely at fault"
1084,5,Good Value,"This was a great product, just what I needed and just as pictured. I use these to sit on a couch and watch video on my computer and they work great."
1085,5,Exactly as advertised,Nothing really to say. Works fine. No crackle. Fairly sturdy and hold up against weather. Great for DJ equipment or in the house.
1086,1,Didn't get what I ordered,I ordered the headphone extension (1 male end/1 female end) and got a 15 foot auxiliary plug (2 male ends). I decided that it would be cheaper to buy a stereo coupler of 2 female ends than it would be to ship it back.
1087,1,Laughing out loud,As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.
1088,1,Don't buy NuVision Edition,"I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"
1089,5,Simply well done.,"I bought this Cd after watching the movie. I thought the movie was amazing, this CD is quite literally out of this world. The music is hot yet playful, it's sultry yet cool. This has done what most albums don't - sound good."
1090,5,TRIPLETS IS WORTH ALL THREE STARS!,"Play one of the three versions of the Academy Award nominated (hopefully winning) title track, ""Belleville Rendezvous"" and tell me it is not the most unique and inspirational song of the year. I can't get it out of my head! The film is a knockout and Ben Charest's magic in the music is worth every dime."
1091,2,What Happened?,"Okay, first off, I love Loving Family. I have the Twin Time and all of the accessories AND the old dolls. But when I received the new dolls as I gift, I was shocked. Mattel has completely changed the dolls from sleek to chunky. These dolls apparently look a lot like the ones they made back in the 90's. If you want dolls for your Loving Family house, try to get the old ones on eBay."
1092,5,Perfect match,"I couldn't find my original and I couldn't charge my camera, I was begining to panic because the holidays were coming. The order came fast and saved my holiday photo's."
1093,3,It's a battery charger,"Does it's job. I can't rate above 3 stars because it is a battery charger and I find no real joy from this product, but the need was apparent when we lost our old one."
1094,5,Exactly what I ordered.,This product is exactly what I ordered. The same charger that originally came with my camera. I am very pleased. (and happy that I am able to bring my camera back to life!)
1095,2,JANET JACKSON - VELVET ROPE TOUR,"Well another one of my first dvd purchases...I found this concert very poor...it did nothing for me... the sound quality was poor, The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle, Janet's performance was glitzy... but sadly something was missing...my advice is puchase Janet's later DVDS..."
1096,4,"Spectacular Production Of Lights, Dance, Energy and Janet","This is a very good live concert VHS tape with high energy and lots of colorful lights. Janet Jackson gives a 2 hour, non stop, performance in a 1998 release with Janet at her peak performance. The majority of her songs she sings live, not lip-synching. The experience of watching the video is close to being at a live concert in one of the front rows."
1097,1,Low quality dvd,"I know I am just writing this review now but the dvd I purchased was not in good quality. I am not sure it because the actual concert was 10 to 15 year old but I did not enjoy this copy at all.thank you,Charisse Chase"
1098,2,Are we discussing the same DVD?,Mostly crowd noises and Ms Jackson basking in the adoration -- did I miss something?
1099,1,Wack She ain't Michael,"Janet Jackson works very hard.I will give her that But when she isn't biting Madonna, she is trying hard to be a 2nd tier Version of Her Brother which she will never be able to do.She can't sing& is a So-So Dancer.The Music&Production is what really has Her Name up in Lights in the First&Only Place."
1100,3,Hmmm....Ok at best...,"Janet Jackson is a very talented women. I will give her that much...but she tries way to hard to be Madonna. Madonna did the whole tie me up thing before you, Janet, and it was obvious that you copied her. But it's all good. The show was great, and unlike Madonna (who sings NO old songs) Janet sang almost all of her greatest hits from the 80s which was awesome. She could have put some more color into the show...and gosh take off those black slacks. The dancer with the short bleached blonde hair was annoying to no extent but the other dancers were cool. The only problem with this concert, is that the transition from one song to the other is really awkward. She should have really thought out the order of each song much better than what she actually did. She should have opened with a hit song too, and done much more with Got 'til It's Gone. Buy this video, it's fun to watch....but lacks a lot of thought."
1101,5,Like it a lot!,"I'm a music/movement teacher and needed something to help me lug my Altec IM7 back and forth with that would be convenient.After reading reviews from others online I decided this harness seemed like a good bet, and I was right.It holds my IM7 snugly and makes it easy for me to carry it around without my needing to take it in and out of a bag in order to use it.Strap feels just fine, quality seems great, and I'm very happy with it overall."
1102,4,nice stickers,"These are nice stickers and a fair quantity for the price, however my kids prefer the activity books which allow them to decorate scenes on the plastic coated booklet with the stickers. These stickers are not meant to be stuck to the book, but can be used to decorate other things or wear on their clothes, etc."
1103,5,dinasours,the only thing that I wished the book were bigger and thicker... but in another word the book was great
1104,2,Brilliant Movie - Dreadful DVD,"Kino Video ought to be embarrassed to release such a poor quality print on DVD. What everyone has said about the transfer is true. It is truly dreadful. There are better copies of this film on VHS. At one point Joan backs away from the camera in horror until her performance is nothing but a fuzzy blur.Joan Crawford's work deserves better treatment. Hopefully the upcoming Crawford boxed set from Warner Bros will include a better version of this film. Keep your fingers crossed.That said, I love this movie, even with it's ridiculous ending. That milk! Those eyes! But why does Joan's character cry out in warning at the end of the film only to smirk pridefully as she walks away?"
1105,5,Real Fear,Joan Crawford creates a portrait of fear that will have you on the edge of your seat. We expect a winning performance from her but we also get Jack Palance in a stellar turn as her husband. There's also dazzling camera work that makes brilliant use of light and shadow. This is a must for Crawford fans and anyone else who appreciates how movies were made back in the 40s and 50s.
1106,2,Masochist Dearest,"Can anyone who watches this movie ever erase from their mind the scene where Crawford finds out Palance and Grahame are plotting to kill her and goes stark, raving mad? It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance."
1107,3,My VIEWS!!,"This book was pretty good. There are a lot of key things I felt was important for men and females to know. I especially loved how at the end she broke down some key topics that many of us females are facing today. This book talks about love, relationships, homosexuality (no pro's), poverty, heartache, etc! So many emotions wrapped up in one. This was a slow read for me and it took over a month. I would start some, then put it down for a week and finish back. It wasn't a stay up all night page turner, but it def was a good read!"
1108,5,Great Book,Sister Souljah is so down to earth...no pretense. I love it. I am giving this to my 16 year old granddaughter to read. Let's be real. Our young ladies need to hear the truth in a way that they can relate.
1109,5,AWESOME BOOK!!,"This book was amazing!!! If there is one book that everyone (white, black, latino, etc) should read, it is definitely this book! It is very hard to set this book down once you begin to read it. The scary thing about this book is that it is true. The information about the thousands of African-American youth living in welfare hotels and damaged families are present in the US. After finishing this book, you should be more inspired in help others in need.I love this book and I highly recommend it."
1110,1,"RACIST,HOMOPHOBIC, HATE MONGER","And those are the nice things I have to say about this woman and her book. She's a young woman with a LOT to learn. She sounds like a one of those white far-right ""Christian"" nuts.By the way, if she doesn't believe in interracial relationships, why does she work with Sean ""Puffy"" Combs, who is dating Jennifer Lopez? Souljah would probably rationalize that Sean was driven to make it with Jennifer by our racist society. (Sean looks to me like he's having fun!)"
1111,1,Whitey is oppressing you?,They agreed to publish and largely distribute one of her books. Most whites in this country will never have such a luxury. Hypocrite. Racist.
1112,4,Enjoyed this book a lot,"I agree with what Sista Souljah has to say about being socially retarded and just plain not knowing about different types of people that are no good for you. In life I have learned that there are people who you will meet that are not worthy of you knowing on any level. It's nothing personal, but there are just some people who you will meet in life that are just full of it and have no aspirations, goals and/or plans in life. Sista Souljah does speak the truth on many issues such as racism, sexism, being intelligent and at the same time being overlooked in the black community, poverty and education.I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to question our status as Africans living in America."
1113,5,this is nice,This book was beautiful. I still can't believe all those things happened to her. Some people have the worst. I think she is a good symbol of the Black woman. Keep on keepin' on Sista!
1114,3,My 1st FW experience.,"I have not listened to this disc in some time so keep that in mind as I tell you that I remember it being decent, but nothing outstanding. Being a prog fan, some will probably want to horse-whip me after learning that I have never really listened to Fates Warning much-yet. I've been meaning to get into more of their stuff, but well, you know how life is....That said, I specifically remember the opening track being OUTSTANDING. The rest has not stuck in my head, but I will give it another chance. Perhaps there are better FW albums I should explore-I want to give them the benefit of the doubt after the glowing things I've read about them..."
1115,4,Good Information,"I agree that her delivery of the information can be a little silly or goofy, but this DVD is worth buying. It contains alot of good information. My husband and I did not want to go to child birth classes. Instead we bought and watched this DVD. It saved us time and money! It also allowed us to learn at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home."
1116,5,Great Video,"Although the woman who teaches you on this video is very opinionated, she does a great job teaching you everything you could imagine needing to know about child birth. After viewing this video I am much more educated on the topic and prepared for Labor and Delivery. I will defiantly loan this video out to any of my friends having a baby. And they didn't spend a ton of time on breathing techniques which tends to be a major focus of Lamaze classes. I defiantly feel more comfortable about trying a natural delivery."
1117,1,Hard program to watch,"This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth."
1118,5,Great book for expectant parents,"My daughter and husband couldn't afford Lamaze classes, so I bought the book. It gave them a good foundation and they viewed the DVD several times it held so much information for them. It was a great purchase."
1119,1,"Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!","This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff."
1120,2,Don't waste your money,"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."
1121,3,Outdated and Not Funny,"Especially her antics with the forceps (not funny). There is some good information in here but fot the love of humans, I hope that this is not anyone's sole source of preparation. I feel she scares women too much and perhaps because she is a nurse, has the ""doctors are gods"" attitude. I would like to see a DVD by a midwife with a less medical attitude towards childbirth for those people who are not able for whatever reason to read books like ""Childbirth at Home"" by Marion Sousa or anything by Sheila Kitzinger.I'm sure some will disagree with me but as a veteran doula and homebirth advocate, these are my feelings."
1122,5,First Time Mom in WI,"I loved this series. My husband and I watched it instead of attending the hospital class (which conflicted with our work schedules). It had us totally prepared for labor & delivery, and I highly recommend it."
1123,2,Just ok,"The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch."
1124,3,Informative but annoying,"You may just love this lady, but I personally found her pretty annoying. But then again I wasn't real excited to be watching so many hours on the subject. It's informative, I would recommend it, but it could have been shortened without this lady's not-very-funny humor in my opinion. I would have preferred just the facts in a shorter version. The 2 DVDs are at least 3 hours altogether I believe."
1125,1,Ruined my life..,"I'm an expected father to be, and I thought this DVD would help me show my caring compassionate side... I was trying to be part of the whole child birthing process. Thing is, this DVD provoked an unearthly rage in my spouse. While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information. My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. The information she did give is easily obtainable from a free pamphlet. When I told my spouse I paid $[...] for the movie she freaked! [...]"
1126,4,I only give it 4 as the sound quality was bad,"I don't know if it was just the DVD I got, but the sound quality was pretty bad on spots. May be because all 5 sections were squeezed onto one disc? That is my only complaint. It is very informative and we have watched it through once and will break it down into sections over the next couple of months. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't have time to get to a class. Again, my only complaint is sound quality."
1127,4,Very Helpful,"My husband traveled for his job so, there was no way to schedule for Lamaze classes. The video was very helpful to him. I recommend this video for any couples who are unable to attend Lamaze classes together.The info was easy to understand and very convenient."
1128,1,annoying instructor- waste of time,"I wish I could give this video 0 stars. Don't waste your money on this video. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny. She is not funny. The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) Also, the footage appears to be from the mid 1990's- very dated, it's like watching a VHS recording. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this- you'll see."
1129,4,very informative,"I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I found this to be just what I needed. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time. I like the fact that I can go back and review parts of it whenever I want. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have."
1130,4,Better than taking a class!,"This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!"
1131,4,Very Good sessions,"To begin with, the only reason i didn't give this DVD 5 stars was because of the video and audio quality - it was not upto DVD standards, and looked like it had been converted from the video format into DVD.The reason why we bought this DVD was due to lack of time to attend an actual LAMAZE course. We had attended one for our first baby, so this was more like a refresher at our convenience.Having said that, i would like to say that the sessions were very informative, educative, and well paced.Sheri does tend to get a bit ""loud"" in some sessions, but overall she has done an excellent job of providing the necessary information and tips, and answers to questions, that all expectant mothers are looking for.Will recommend this to friends for sure."
1132,5,Birthing Class,"This is real simple, broken down, realistic examples, spoken with expirience. My wife and I didn't have the time to register and physically go to a class, the dvd turned out to be a better method anyway, we watch it once a week leading up to our time!"
1133,4,Great Video,"This is a good, very helpful video that made me feel a lot more informed about the birthing process."
1134,2,Disappointed,"I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price."
1135,5,Must have for expectant moms and dads.,This DVD is perfect for expecting mothers and fathers. It tells you everything you need to know about child birth. Fathers will find it interesting too. I felt a lot more prepared and confident about having a baby after watching it.
1136,3,Not for Educators- Good for Soon to be Parents,"Overall, it's a good video for soon to be parents. As a childbirth educatior, I was looking for something with more graphics and illustrations to sum up my discussions during my childbirth classes.A little too much talking and not enough demonstrations so I returned the video."
1137,4,A lot of helpful information,"I had heard mixed reviews of the child birth classes at my hospital. So, the idea of spending 6 hours in a class that I wasn't even sure would be helpful wasn't appealing to me or my husband. I selected this DVD based on the other reviews. My husband and I have been watching it one section at a time, since each section is between 30 and 45 minutes. There is a lot of useful information, such as early signs of labor, the stages of labor, and alternatives to what she calls ""normal birth"". However, there is definitely a preaching tone about not using any type of medications during labor and even though she discusses them; she definitely makes her opinions known. Still, if you don't have a good child birth class available to you, this is better than nothing. Perhaps balance this with the bookThe Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancyby Vicki Iovine for a different point of view."
1138,4,laugh and learn about childbirth,Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.
1139,4,Human Touch Massage Chair HT125,"I've had my chair for a few weeks now. In general, I like it. But before you buy it, test it out. The channels for your calves are quite narrow. I doubt grown men could use this feature. Also be aware that on this model, massage functions stop at the upper neck and don't really do shoulders or neck. It's a little noisy as well... the leather squeaks while in use. Won't bother you, but might bother others! All that said though, I am enjoying it and it's my unwind before I go to sleep at night."
1140,2,"WARNING: ARGENTO, ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL",This film lacks all the elements that make Argento's movies great and fun to watch. There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project.
1141,4,"intoxicating horror,talking pantings, asia goes crazy","this will make you wonder about killers souls,can they enter peoples bodys after they die, why do normal people suddenly go crazy, a killing spree ...!!! this movie goes there."
1142,2,"Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie","Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5."
1143,3,"Argento's thriller starts well, but then turns predictable.","The first half of Dario Argento's hypnotic thriller is on a par with some of his early giallo classics, but then it slips a notch, becoming a rather routine slasher/revenge movie that borrows heavily from Ms. 45 and Psycho. The viewer is forced to wait for the film to ackowledge what the genre savy will, no doubt, already know in its remaining hour. The ending is atypically gentle for an Argento outing, perhaps he's getting mellow in his old age. Ennio Morricone's score is suitably chilling, the soundtrack is worth seeking out."
1144,3,Good for Killing Some Time..,"Haley Andromeda Harmony is neurotic! She is an extreme hypochondriac and worries about pretty much everything. I thought this book was decently written, but I really disliked Haley's friends, Kiki and Jules. Throughout the entire book, Haley kept complaining about how she couldn't stand them and how they were always making fun of her, and 10 pages later, she was friends with them again. Kiki actually ended up being a decent friend to Haley, but Jules wasn't at all! I just don't understand why a person would be friends with someone who didn't respect them or treat them kindly. However, Haley was an authentic teenage character (albeit an overanxious one). This book was also written in epistolary format, which I've always loved. Cute, fluffy read."
1145,3,Not much on MegaMillions,I purchased this book thinking it would tell a lot on Mega Millions but found out otherwise. The book is mostly on Powerball.Didn't go into the book much so I can't comment on that. I have returned it already.
1146,4,Apple travel plugs well made,"I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need."
1147,4,Worked Great,"I traveled to London for several weeks, and was concerned about charging my laptop from all the mixed reviews I read online. The adapter worked great, and I didn't need a power converter. Granted, it is more expensive than other adapters, but for me I loved the ease of not having to worry if anything would happen to my computer."
1148,3,"Less energy, less sarcasm","I was stunned by Mary Prankster's first CD, ""Blue Skies over Dundalk"". Her cynicism cut me to the bone.Regrettably, although pleasant, her new album ""Roulette Girl"" lacks the drive, the wit, and the drug-induced hallucinations of ""Blue Skies"". Only one song, ""Mata Hari"", approached the sheer energy of the first album, and even it struck me as a poorer, gentler ripoff of ""Sadie Hawkins Day"".In a way, this CD brought (gasp!) Gordon Lightfoot's career to my mind -- his early albums showed genius in his songwriting and lyrics, but he ran out of things to say long before he stopped producing new music, resulting in dull travesties such as ""Protocol"".If you don't have it already, buy ""Blue Skies over Dundalk"" first, and fall in love with it. Later, if you feel like it, this one will complete the set for the time being. With luck, she will find her muse again before her next CD."
1149,2,Size way too big,"This shirt was labeled Large, but it was more along the lines of XL to XXL. Unfortunately after paying extra shipping charges, I had to pay more shipping charges to return. I won't buy from this supplier again unless they offer free return shipping."
1150,3,ok,Outstanding service Shop on line and you can save money.yes i would buy again.and again..no problemswould tell a friend
1151,4,A very clear picture of the English language,I enjoyed reading this and brushing up on my grammar. I thing I whould have done better at school if I had this then.
1152,3,Healthy for your language,"Easy to read, but i wish it provides more practical information. Definitely stays on my Kindle, so I could use it when needed"
1153,5,Should Be Required in All of Public Education,"While this book is described by some as ""old"", and even by a few as ""boring"", it is a great and valuable reference for those who sincerely want to learn the correct way to use the English language. Granted the art of correct spelling, grammar, speech, and composition has largely (and most unfortunately) disappeared from our culture, but the most successful among us will be those who can properly and effectively compose and present our thoughts... verbally and on paper. Those who choose to be left behind in this facet of communication do so at their own risk.This is a free book, but worth its (published and printed) weight in gold."
1154,1,I have not received the item,"I have not received the item that I bought. I amjust waiting for some extra days in order to send a claim or a complain.Rgrds,Xavier Arderiu"
1155,4,solid and raw old skool trash with a difference,"From the openning shrieks of ""Voivooooooooodddd..."" to the distinctive odd-beat of closing ""Nuclear War"" this is a great recording. Maybe its just me but I hear some musical influences from Motorhead to vocal nods to Rob Halford in the mix...all wondrous stuff w/superb musicialship by the Players and well constructed songs with good hooks and distinctive rythms not all sounding...lots of variety and tempo. Powerful raw production cuts like a razor. Excellent."
1156,5,I love the entire series,I'm surprised these aren't very well known. The music and songs are just interesting and leave me feeling uplifted. Also interesting in that they traditionally don't use any real words - just sounds that sound like they could be words.
1157,2,What ever happened to Barbara Crampton?,"In Movieland, some people are just born for certain parts. This was a Jeffrey Combs/Barbara Crampton movie if there ever was one. All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time. Oh, and Joe Estavez...Talk about unintentionally hilarious!!!."
1158,4,An actual comedy!,"What an enjoyable film! Funny from start to finish and full of little visual laughs. Leave it to the French (or British, or Italians) to be heartwarminly politically incorrect. Just go see it."
1159,5,Bought them for breathing problems from Congestive Heart Failure,"This is a wonderful product, worth every penny. The foam density is just right. I bought two bed wedges so that my husband & I can be side-by-side at night, and together they fit our queen size waterbed perfectly. I had two sets of pillow cases made by a skilled seamstress for the wedges and the neck and lumbar pillows.We, too, find that our bodies ""creep"" downwards during the night. My Dad was an invalid in the '60s with a rented hospital bed at home (with the back raised to assist his breathing), and I recall that it was a problem for him, too. Whenever we went into his room, he would ask us to help pull him back up... I would like to hear from someone as to how we might overcome this.I would recommend the Prop-Up Pillow to everyone who has a CHF diagnosis."
1160,5,Totally awsome!! simply the best!!,"There aren't enough words to describe this work of art, but I'll do my best with what I have. I was just amazed, to say the least, when I read the last page of Clan of the Cave Bear, with craving for more. The story line is simply magnificent and richly detailed. it's just something that keeps you on your seat. And reading the whole series, I still want more. I'm extremelly confident that the next bok will deliver the same kind of exitment the others did."
1161,1,Tedious,"This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1162,5,A total escape that I couldn't put down!,"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this book! I have an interest in anthropology, have always heard of it and have been almost embarrassed not to have read it! I bought it just to see what all the hype was about, but was quickly absorbed and thoroughly enjoyed the story. I rarely have time to read fictional novels, but I stayed awake four hours on a red-eye flight to finish it!The main characters and story are great, some parts are a little far-fetched and certain characters are exaggerated, but the overall story is captivating. It left me running to buy the second Earth Child book!"
1163,3,A good yarn,"Not incredibly well written, but the research and effort is evident, and the world is fascinating. Could do without the graphic sex."
1164,4,Extremely entertaining and educational,"This book was recommended to me by a former student of mine who is into survival skills and primitive living. Respecting his opinion, I picked up the book. Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The contrast and conflict introduced by having a young Cro-Magnon woman raised by Neandertals was a an excellent vehicle for the story. The author seems to have done her homework on the ice age as well. Although I don't know about her speculations on the nature of Neandertal society and their brain structure and function, they were fascinating. These people become such an integral part of the story that by the end of the book when you begin to realize that they, as a group, are going to pass away soon, it brings a poignant sadness. Well written, excellent characterization."
1165,2,Prehistorical Meandering Story,"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."
1166,4,"Fourth read, and still fun","I just read some of the 1-star reviews, and found that while I do agree with some of the objections, I still enjoyed the book on this, the fourth read.I agree with one person who points out the unbelievable regularity with which Ayla makes discoveries. However, I chose to overlook it and just enjoy the story. If you want accurate factual history, you may want to look elsewhere. If you want to be entertained, read the book.I am impressed by the amount of research Ms. Auel obviously did regarding herbal medicine. I understand that she did a lot of research and some of the incidents in the story portray a possible reason for some of the archaeological finds, such as the inclusion of certain unusual objects in a burial cairn.I enjoyed the book, and look forward to the release of the newest book, Land of the Painted Caves. Since it is always such a long time between books, I like to refresh my memory, and greatly enjoy so doing."
1167,5,a classic,"What an incredible journey into prehistoric times! This book is so vivid, so moving, and has exquisite detail about Ayla's world- both her personal feelings and experiences and the civilization she finds herself in. Do not miss this book."
1168,4,"At last, a new hardcover edition on the market!","Well, I don't think that I have to convince anyone that this is a good book and the beginning of a good series. I wanted, instead, to express my gratitude that there is a standard-size harcover edition of The Clan of the Cave Bear again to buy. The other three books in the series have remained in print for years, but I could never locate a hard copy of the first novel. A couple of years ago, they re-released the hardcover, but it was in a smaller format, so it didn't match the others.Now, there is the hardcover again, along with the sneak peek at the new novel!"
1169,5,Couldn't put it down.,"Wonderful story. I bought this on my Kindle, and I enjoyed it so much I will be buying it from Amazon as a set.The contents of the book makes you appreciate where we all came from.Jean Auel writes so well, you feel as thoughyou are actually ""in"" the story."
1170,5,Totally Amazing! All of them!,"I have read all 4 books in this series and I can't get enough. Jean Auel is a literary genius. I am an herbalist so all the medicine woman information keeps me in its grip with extreme facination. Im dying to read the fifth book. Ayla, your my hero! Lanita"
1171,3,"Interesting, but not great literature","This has definitely become a cult classic. I really liked the book the first time around, and it is a compelling story, but it definitely has some flaws. One of the biggest is Auel's writing. Her story ideas are good, but the execution is not great. Oh, let's face it, she writes like a tenth grader. An imaginative tenth grader, to be sure, but a tenth grader just the same. With that in mind, the best audience for this book is the high school crowd. Ayla has that whole teen rebellion thing going. As I've gotten older, she keeps getting less sympathetic. Seriously, it almost seems like she goes out of her way to get into trouble, and that whole ""she was different, she couldn't help it"" line just sounds like an excuse for her lack of self-control. Just because one has the ability to break every rule of their society, doesn't mean one should, but she's smart,blonde and pretty, so we'll build a series around her.<sigh>"
1172,3,"Fun read, but kind of boring","I should have expected this, but it was kind of out of date and got to be boring. However, I did enjoy it as a quick, light read."
1173,4,A pleasure to read,"Most birding books are best perused, but Dennis's books are a pleasure to read cover to cover. Also, the illustrations are incredibly perfect and gorgeously detailed.Plenty of personally-acquired information here, including some tips for deterring squirrels and other pests."
1174,4,I have got it! It is in good state,"I choose 4, because the book has some scuff, but it is ok! The cost is $0,01! I have got it in time!"
1175,4,Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!,"Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists. The CD package was broken.....Other than that, it was fun to play it as the children in my art class painted their own version of""Boogie Woogie Broadway"" by Mondrian.Art Specialist --- Las Vegas, Nevada"
1176,5,"A powerful, moving film you can't stop watching....","even as it races towards its inevitable and forgone conclusion. This movie reached me in a place I didn't even know I had. Jesus Nebot's acting and directing ability should make him an international star. To me the two main characters in this drama are Pablo and Mrs. Knight, the bereaved mother (played by JAG's Susan Haskell in a gut-wrenching performance), forever connected to each other by an accidental tragedy with a cosmic resolution. This movie will stay with you."
1177,4,Nice companion to 'Warplanes of the Third Reich',"There are quite a few books about this subject on the market, and I rate this one second best. Top of the market in my eyes is 'Warplanes of the Third Reich' by William Green (672 pages!), but this book can serve as a nice companion or indeed as a replacement if your budget is a bit tight. The main advantage this book has compared to William Green masterpiece is the colour artwork, which is sadly lacking in the Green book. The only thing in which the comparison falls out negative against Green is the amount of information about each individual plane, but there is more general information about the Luftwaffe in WW2 to make this up. Highly recommended indeed."
1178,3,First Impression,"Good Graphics, Ok gameplay that might get better as you play the game more, but if you are looking relive the experience of Final Fantasy Tactics this game falls short. There is not as much tactical strategy here, the system seems more based on who is stronger or has the better weapon. I have only played a few chapters, but it hasent caught my interest yet. Perhpas it will become more involved as the game progresses. Rent and Try before you buy."
1179,5,cool story,if your a fan of FE well you will like this shift from portable console to home console. its really great story and characters that are intresting. its easy gameplay and worth beating a few timez to get new characters that you actualg koll during story mode its really good and some intresting twists and plots r hidden. by the way just making this clear this game does NOT star Marth from Super Smash Bros. Melee.
1180,1,???,This thing has about 3 poems in it. Terrible! Do NOT waste your time!!!!!!! Extra words extra words extra words
1181,1,This should not be listed on Amazon,"This was a gigando rip-off! It does not even contain the ""The Owl and the Pussycat,"" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."
1182,2,No illustrations,"The Kindle version has no illustrations, and the formatting makes it hard to read and enjoy the verses. The limericks appear without logical line shifts, and where the illustration is supposed to be, it just says [illustration] which is a lot more annoying than not having anything there at all.It's free, but it's hard to read and that kind of takes the fun out of it, at least for me."
1183,2,Kindle version - lost formatting,"Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment. Both the formatting and the illustrations have been lost. In my opinion, the charm of a book like this is often in the accompanying illustrations. It would be better to buy a complete version than download this one."
1184,4,Great source for info,This is a worthwhile purchase. Initially I hesitated buying it but the information is extremely helpful even for the most seasoned professional photographer. If you are starting out this is invaluable.
1185,5,halloween book,we just love halloween and we like this book cause it has some very cool things to make and we like to add different things each year. plus it is a very fun way to get the whole family involved and have some fun and grow stronger. thanks
1186,4,Thuvia,"As with the series of John Carter, I enjoyed Thuvia very much. They are all great books of science fiction"
1187,4,Fun read,Burroughs is always worth the investment of a little time when you are in need a good escape from reality
1188,2,Boring,"Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and ""Afternoon Speaker"" is it. It even gets a bit monotonous, but at least it's perky and interesting. Pretty much everything else on there puts me to sleep."
1189,3,"Good musicians, but....","...I was pretty bored with it by the 8th or 9th song. The songs just kinda blend into each other. I do like the vocals though. I hear ""Reason to Live"" is better."
1190,4,Those alien babes are pretty hot!,"This great-looking brunette comes to earth to experience our physical relationships, and she leaves having accomplished her mission. Some imaginative scenes --- the best were the girl-girl encounters (at least in my opinion!) I especially liked the ""performance art"" exhibit attended by our alien hottie, in which the decadent artsy babe running the show ""uses"" a sexy blonde bimbo as her ""canvas"". It may not really be art, but I like it!"
1191,3,Sexy star who goes looking for earthly love.,"Bought movie because the cover was sexy and was being sold for 3.99. Best 4 bucks I've spent in a while. Sci-fi bufs should watch for a change of pace. The star is beautiful and spends a lot of time learning about what earth sex is all about, most of it with her in various sexy poses. A cool, sexy surprise."
1192,5,Well Worth Watching,"Like the movies ""Titanic"" and ""The Great Escape"", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the ""Lafayette Escadrille"". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen ""The DaVinci Code"" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."
1193,4,WWI movie review,"This was an excellent movie that followed historical facts, more or less, and had superb flight sequences (that I assumed were computerized.) There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual ""composite characters"" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a ""team,"" but this was better than most. I probably should have given it 5 stars, but I reserve those ratings for the truly outstanding movie that comes along rarely."
1194,3,Its allright,The computer generated action were just that. The characters were so so. The best part I thought was at the end...
1195,3,Can someone review the DVD and not the movie please?,"Come on folks, how good is the DVD??????, you know - the thing amazon is selling that you are supposed to be reviewing??!?!??!!??This is not netflix!"
1196,2,Hollywood commercial film-making to the bone,"Every possible cliche is here. The sound track smashes you in the head all the time. GCI battles cuks the life out of the movie. I'd prefer to watch again 1966's ""The Blue Max"" thatn ""Flyboys"".However, what makes this fil going and even somewhat tender to watch are the performances. There's some eracl acting here by James Franco and Jean Reno and the supoorting cast, even if they all clearly know this is an extremely commercial and cliched movie."
1197,3,iT'S OK BUT YOU MAY THINK OTHERWISE...,I like its timing and all but everything else it's to say...do you know or understand what I mean??????????? OK.
1198,1,Save Your Money,"Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"
1199,4,The critics don't get it,"For some reason, critics generally don't get this type of movie. Maybe they're too young. Maybe they have no affection for (or perhaps knowledge of) the genre war movies of the 40s. They want these movies to be ""meaningful"". They want them to ""resonate"".But movies like this are just fun, like the old Errol Flynn/Clark Gable/John Wayne movies. They are Saturday afternoon popcorn movies, and there aren't nearly enough of them. I didn't care how ""accurate"" the movie was. I had fun. I loved it. And the romance (no sex) occupied only a small part of it, as it should (unlike Pearl Harbor, which sank under the weight of it).4 stars out of 5 due to its being somewhat overlong. But it definitely should be seen at least once on the big screen.Old-fashioned, cliche-ridden, and predictable. But loads of fun. Highly recommended."
1200,5,FLYBOYS,I enjoyed this movie as it was entertaining with a war era/love story theme. It hit pretty high marks on both of these targets. The cinematography was nice and the love story was good. If you are looking for newsreel stuff on World War l go to the history channel because this will not take care of you. First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there. To see Jennifer Decker get a role and nail it like she did makes this film a winner and a movie that will go in my personal collection. If you liked the movie Pearl Harbor you will really enjoy this film as well.
1201,4,No cliches just a slice of history.,This isn't a great movie. It's a good movie. It's worth the time and money. I liked it for two reasons: It provided a look at an remarkable piece of history and gave the viewer a sense of how loss effected the new fliers. It's applicable today. I came back with another new distinction about life.
1202,1,Crap.,"Incredibly uninteresting film with characters you don't care about, a nondescript and swelling music score that all but drowns out whatever mumbled diagloue there is, and a computer-game feel to the aerial sequences. Really tedious. If you want to watch a movie about aviators in World War I, watch ""The Dawn Patrol"" with Errol Flynn and David Niven."
1203,5,A must read for any noir fan.,"The two volumns are a must read for any noir, mystery or detective story fan. The quality of both volumns is great: it's library quality. It only contains the more public stories and novels and essays. To find the ones Chandler did not want well known you have to look elsewhere (he cut them up and put them in the novels you see the this set). The only criticism I have is that the Notes and Chandler Time-line are both a little weak. There are lots of slang and arcane jargon of the 30s and 40s that should have been defined. Only a small number of entries are found. But, if you want to read the master, this is it. Just buy both volumns and then look for the ""lost stories"" of Chandler to fill in the gaps."
1204,2,To waste time only.,"If, according to the editorial review, you either desire to lavish the director of this picture with affection or to slap him silly, I advocate the latter. An amateurish attempt to lend some ""hipper than thou"" gloss to a mediocre plotline. Even the actors themselves seem uninspired by the material. Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."
1205,4,A Real Sleeper,"Sophomoric, in my mind, means manipulative - visually, verbally, and through the pacing and continuity. This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate."
1206,1,Confused Fairy-World,"At page 250 of this fantasy/fairy-tale novel by a prestigious British author, the main character, 17-year old Joanna says, ""This is getting very confusing."" That about sums up this mixed-up, hard-to-follow book about the loss and reclamation of Fairyland. Perhaps, it was more understandable to Brits? I just didn't get it or feel wowed or caused to suspend my disbelief."
1207,3,Great Music - But know what you're buying.,"First of all, let me say that I have no problem with the music on this CD. Every song on this CD--every single one--is 5 star material. However, the buyer should realize that this compilation CD has not one, but TWO mislabeled tracks. The track labeled ""Stardust"" is actually ""Yesterdays"" from the ""Clifford Brown With Strings"" album. Also, the track labeled, ""If I Love Again"" is, in reality, ""Gerkin For Perkin"" from ""Study in Brown"". This error is pure sloppiness on the part of Verve records, and is likely to confuse the uninitiated."
1208,2,TeddyBears,"Okay...........I'll admit that The TeddyBears got a good hit in ""CobraStyle"".........however, someone out there please reference me back to a hit from the 60's or 70's that has the same beat and melody and a lot of organ and drums.Please...............it is driving me crazyTed in the Sanitarium Lobby"
1209,3,not too bad......,"Ive seen lots worse than this. The story is good enough to make a movieabout it. Its only a movie, so i did not try to tie in too much logic to it and i ended up liking it. Creepy doctor with a chip on his shoulder dont like tourists and has personal plans for some of them.I enjoyed the scenery, the waterfalls, the forest...much better than amovie shot inside a studio.Bottom line, good for a viewing or two."
1210,3,Not my usual cup of tea,"Not my usual cup of tea, but I did enjoy it. It's a bit messy, especially when the main reason we should be afraid or disgusted comes around.Of course it depends on where you line is for such movies."
1211,2,2 stars for 2 scenes,"1 girl running off cliff and 1 girl still awake while being operated on (creepy).other than those scenes,its basically the son of hostel."
1212,1,It's like watching the show LOST!,Is it just me or did I feel like I was watching a missing episode of the show Lost? Just kiddin but anyways I thought it was a lil like the show Lost a bit but this movie was horrible. Do not watch it!
1213,1,suckfest,"if you gave this movie more than 1 star you are high. no plot , bad acting, and too gruesome for theaters...NOT!!.the movie goes on for an hour before anything happens and then its' just downhill from there.not gorry just boring..."
1214,3,Not bad. Not great.,"After seeing the trailer for Turistas, I was vert eager to see it. Its a little misleading because none of the action starts until an hour into the film. Even the action is not that satisfying. there are some good scenes involving the victims but not enough. Not as bloody or scary as Hostel, but it does have its good moments (particularly a scene on an operating table). Not a great horror film but just manages to support enough tension and gore to pass."
1215,4,Good Video for 7 year old boys,"This movie was cute, but the best part of my experience was the service. I was trying to get this movie for my son's birthday on short notice. We took 6 boys to an NHL hockey game and they watched the movie on the long ride to the arena. They loved it. The seller expedited the order and was great about making sure it arrived on time!"
1216,3,Just about Ray-dee for the world.....,"Considering I didn't like any of his other CD'S. I actually was suprisingly impressed with this album. A few hot tracks consist of ""melody"", ""anytime"", raydiation intro, what I need, and lets play house. However, on ""I wish"" he sounds like he is about to pass out because he is straining his voice so much. Overall I give this album a 7 out of 10- I feel he has talent its just taking a while to cultivate."
1217,2,What happened to this man?,"I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."
1218,2,He's not quite there yet...,"Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted!"
1219,1,WHY?,"Ray J is not a thug... This as well as his image is all a FRAUD. It's insufferable listening to all his whining. Even R. Kelly's presence on ""Quit Actin'"" and Mya on ""Sexy"" are not enough to save this garbage. Ray J take a hint and ""Quit Actin'"" yourself and while you are at it stop singing too."
1220,3,Wishes really do come tru,"Ray J has FINALLY managed to blend in. His video was playin and I wasn't payin attention. It sounded aight, but didn't hold my attention. Thats great. Anytime Ray J can show his face without me laughing is great. I laughed at his last album. I laughed bout him and Kim. I laughed when I realized he was desperate enough to join the cast of Moesha. {Ah, good times those were} Ray J musta wished apon a shining star tho. Cause I {along with the rest o the world} took him seriously this time. 3 stars. Thats what it is. His album is like a mix between Marquis' {Naked} and Usher's {8701} album. Don't wanna call him copy, but thats whats he's goin for. {Hell I don't blame em. I'd do the same thing. Sing, dance, take my shirt off, call it a day} Me being a guy, I'd say he's just as good {but no better} than any other sex symboled artist.{They're all the same 2 me} Waitaminute, Usher can juke. .... Back to the drawing board Ray J"
1221,1,Not as described,"Package says one size fits most queen...well what the heck is most queen because a 1x and a 3x are too different sizes, I am a 1x and this didn't fit over my curves."
1222,2,Disappointing,"Ouch!! Major slip following first two releases which I love. Last two tracks (""Cade Voce"" and ""Words"")are almost noteworthy, but not quite! Save your money on this one unless your a collector. Oh well - maybe next time."
1223,3,"Not what I hoped, but the best there is...","Again, I don't feel this game equals the previous effort of the Dreamcast version (I'm starting to regret trading that console in!). While the graphics are first rate and the franchise option is good and a must in my opinion, the gameplay isn't as flawless as NBA2K2. Shooting suffers from a timing drag not felt in the original, and the camera positioning hasn't been terribly improved. I keep hoping for every franchise to make a jump in seamlessness the way they do in graphics and price, but dissapointingly it's not done here. Still far better than it's competitors, not as surprising and flawless as the football sims."
1224,2,"not that much of a heartache .,","When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it. This is the second book in the all-girl brands series it 's not as good,it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can't feel a whole lot of empathy for the character.THE HEROINE IS JUST SELF CENTRED AND BORING AND YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT THE HERO SEE'S IN HER BESIDES THE FACT SHE IS A MODEL THE HERO DESERVED BETTER."
1225,4,"No Holiday Cheer, But Great Read","This was a very good book. It follows the story of a grown up Tiny Tim, as he struggles in his adult life. The author does a wonderful job describing England and the time they live in. It is dark and a little disturbing, but a great read. I really enjoyed it."
1226,4,Interesting but still not Dickens,"Tiny Tim grows up amid the slums of London. Interesting but not as satisfying as it could have been. There are also some slight anachronisms but I'll let you find them. I'm glad I read it, but it didn't stick in my mind as, let's say, ""Drood"" did."
1227,2,not really a memorable story,"I read this book a couple of months ago and I cannot remember much about the book, it being totally forgetable. Mr. Timothy could be Mr. Fred. There wasn't much of a point to him being ""Tiny Tim"" - just a plain old story. A big disappointment."
1228,3,I expected too much,"When I ordered the coloring book filled with stained glass patterns, I thought it would be a great collection to my stained glass workshop where I have literally hundreds of patterns of stained glass angels. I was looking for something to build a stained glass panel from and these so called patterns don't follow the basic concepts about the way glass naturally breaks. I realize it's a coloring book, but I did expect it to be a bit more realistic. It's not even that I can't modify the designs, but I was so disappointed because I'd wanted something special to build in honor of family members who have passed away."
1229,5,Fabulous psychological drama!,"Ethan Hawke and Kristin Scott Thomas are superb in this film, with a story that will have you guessing until the very end - and maybe thereafter!"
1230,4,Good Deal,"Well builded, not too bright because it's only 3 leds but good enough for camping (my experience, setting up my tent in the night, for example) or ocasional hands free work in dark situations. You can adjust the direction of the light up and down. Excellent deal for the price, I did purchase more tan one."
1231,1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"If you feel you are interested in reading this book I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter. Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a ""Mountain Climber"" would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend ""tip-toes"" each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was ""tip-toeing"" to, with the ""sexy green underware"" she speaks of in her book. Hmm?The book has nothing to do with Mountain Climbing if that is what you are interested in."
1232,1,Self-absorbed garbage,"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece. It consists mainly of diary excerpts and the author's commentaries on them. The only insights for the reader are into the mind of an enormously driven, self-indulgent, and self-absorbed person. Reading this book is a waste of time and money."
1233,2,Stick with Krakauer!,"What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one."
1234,4,ANOTHER FUN SUPER NINTENDO PINBALL GAME 7.5 OUT OF 10,"Pinball Dreams is another fun example of why pinball games on Super Nintendo rule. You get to choose from four stages: Ignition, Steel Wheel, Beat Box, and Nightmare; all of which are fun and challenging stages. All of the levels are uniquely designed and are actually pretty cool. The main problem is though trying to rack up points and the controls need to be tuned up to be more responsive. This game is difficult to get scores as high as hundreds of thousands, which can be a problem but overall doesn't make you notice. I might also add the music for the different stages are great as well, and keep you in the mood to play the game without ever really getting bored. If you like pinball video games the Super Nintendo is your best bet for good pinball games along with various other games because it's still freaking cool."
1235,5,My 2 year old LOVES this!,My husband is a fire fighter and my 2 year old LOVES this dvd. My husband likes it too! Elmo takes a tour of a real fire station and plenty of other Sesame Street fun. If your toddler loves fire trucks and fire fighters he/she will love this.
1236,2,"Grainy, CC only with WMP","This set has a very limited menu - set-up has only audio selection. Most series DVDs allow a ""play all"" option when several episodes are on a platter, this does not.The appearance of the video is slightly grainy, with slight ghosting outlines.This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning. Amazon needs to make that distinction in the descriptions of the DVDs it sells. Hunkering over a computer display is not my preferred method of watching TV.On a positive note, the DVD carrier is the easiest I've been able to pop a disk out of."
1237,3,pretty good show,I have gotten into this show and it is cheaper to buy them here than online so here we are! The acting and writing gets a B and certain charachters drive me nuts (Sara) but otherwise it is somewhat entertaining.
1238,5,This is a fantastic show. There's really nothing like it.,"The Third Season of CSI continues the quality marked by the first and second season. As many have mentioned, the third season continues its in depth focus on crime scene forensics--including acquisition and anlaysis of evidence--and also focuses on the personal characteristics of the CSIs. The third season focuses on Ward comes to grips with a former ex-gang member he went to school with; Grissom meets Lady Heather again, deals with losing hearing; Sarah learns that guys use her; ... This is a fantastic show. There's really nothing like it."
1239,1,Gotta Be There,"I love this show. It is very entertaining, informative and ""gotta be there"". I have 1-5 seasons now and enjoy going back and watching them again and again."
1240,4,The Ultimate Vanessa-Mae,"While there are some pieces on this 2003 album I didn't care for too much, I feel that there are also some excellent works too. In my opinion, Picante, Leyenda, Widescreen and Night Flight are the best works on this album and I really enjoy listening to them."
1241,5,Excellent Practical Reference,"I wrote my Master's thesis on the movement of grasshoppers and almost wore this book out! It became my bible. While I was writing up, you'd always see me with it under my arm. It addresses all of the major movement models from an applied standpoint. The original papers are rarely useful if you wish to actually apply the model to your own research. This book is written more like a text than a review, but is still very thorough mathematically. If you're doing research on movement or are just interested in mathematical models in ecology, this book is a must have."
1242,5,Great Comfort,These things are great! Helps relieve neck and shoulder pain and smells wonderful. Money well invested.
1243,1,I must be on something,"I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened."
1244,1,truly awful.,crispin glover completely ruins this movie. had a pretty good yet uninspired plot....but still decent enough to stick with...UNTIL about half way through and you seriously cant take him anymore....this movie could of been a ton of fun but ended up truly sucking.
1245,2,Riddled With Errors,This book is sloppy and riddled with errors. Coverage of topics is uneven. The author delves into some subjects but tap dances around others. You don't need this book for the FRM. I don't recommend it.
1246,3,Decent,Got this because I got hit in the nuts while playing softball. Worked out perfect for me the next time the player wanted to stop short at the bag.
1247,5,Voivod take it to the next level.,"If you enjoyed ""Nothingface"", then you'll flip over ""Negatron."" Voivod have always been on the verge of something amazing. This is it. New vocalist/bassist Eric Forrest sounds like Snake used to in the old days. This is also Voivod's heaviest outting to date. If you like spaced-out psychotic metal, this is the band for you."
1248,2,Voivod sounding like Exodus?,"I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."
1249,5,(No title).,"Alkan's two sets of Impromptus are anything but run-of-the-mill. Although pretty straight-forward, these character-filled pieces are very interesting, and filled with tang, reminding me of Grieg, Bartok, and Chopin. As Ronald Smith said, they're ""relaxed, uncomplicated pieces designed more for private enjoyment than public exposure."" Although not all, much of this music is very memorable, if not touching. Laurent Martin is a fine Alkan interpreter, and this disc only confirms that status. Very warmly recommended, although the sound in some places leaves something to be desired."
1250,3,Basic yet effective,This book reads like a blue print for medicine ball works as it pertains to developing speed and strength. The exercises presented are the foundation of such work and hence are valuable to the beginner. Those looking for more advanced exercises and techniques will probably be disappointed. Conclusion: great for the beginner.
1251,2,"Great story, no full color prints","I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig ""twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie"".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under ""illustrations"", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the ""River City Press 1978 reprint"""
1252,4,"Concise, comprehensive primer on rose growing","This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days. It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all."
1253,2,2 Stars For Persistence,"Often I feel some admiration for Stephen Pastel and the way he (and Aggie and Katrina) have stayed true to their course and vision with such dogged persistence. So dogged have they been that, having been reviled for years, they're actually more respected than they've ever been.It was with some regret however that I have to report that any admiration I might have evaporates whenever I actually HEAR The Pastels - to be replaced with a feeling of ""can't they find something better to do after all these years"".Now, don't get me wrong, as Pastels go this CD is a lot better than almost anything they've ever done before - still doesn't detract from the fact that this is music by indier-than-thou smug under-achievers made for a captive audience who are, if anything, even smugger. Some people, it seems, are content to stay in their little ghettoes.The lack of talent is excusable, the lack of ambition is not."
1254,2,wireless Camera,This was a great camera for the two days that it worked. I don't know what happend to it. I came home from work on the second day and my screen was all fuzzy. It just stopped working.
1255,2,does not work well,"1) both units require power. the camera does have a 9v adpt but not the receiver. 2) there is always a line of interferance on the monitor cause by noise. Not a good picture.3) Picture quality is not clear, grainy and dis-colored4) 1st range test was only about 50' from base which was located in my bedroom and the camera stopped transmitting in my drive way. I will test it outside later5) ther is no on board memory storage, so you'll have to set up a computer or something.good luck.."
1256,5,MovieHistorian,"This is one of the best movies on organized crime available. It is along the lines of ""Goodfellas"" and ""Donnie Brasco"" although it takes place at a much earlier time in history. It is gritty and factual although artistic license is expected. The movie focuses on Joe Valachi who was the first of the Mafia informants and set the stage for others to follow. The movie gives explicit and factual information on the history of the American Mafia from the original ""bosses"" through the making of the syndicate on through the Vito Genovese regime. It is a must see for anyone interested in the history of organized crime from its very beginning on to the beginning of their decline."
1257,3,Rusty Gold,"When compared to the Heartbreakers' 79 live album, or even 'Add Water and Stir' (the posthumous double live album from '91), this album isn't all that spectacular, regardless of what this other reviewer might believe. On top of that, the lack of any audience noise (if there even IS an audience) makes me believe this is actually a live 'studio' recording.The performance isn't less than entertaining, but even the 'In Cold Blood' album (which compiles several live tracks) is a much better attempt at a live album than this one. It's budget priced, but runs at under 40 minutes.Being a 'take the money and run' performance, notwithstanding, it's still better than a lot of crap that's currently out on the market, including subsequent NY Dolls bootlegs like 'Back in the U.S.A.'. But get the majority of his studio albums, and check this out if you think it's not enough.By no means should you start out with this one, though."
1258,5,A story that just needs to be told.,A story of what could be. A story of what we thought was coming. A story of what still might be.I was supposed to read this is high school but did not. I wish I had. On the level of Catcher in the Rye or To Kill A Mockingbird this novel is thought provoking and never dull.
1259,4,Depressing stuff,"Depressing stuff and quite emotional, considering that I have experienced some of this dismal world for 18 years (xUSSR). On the other hand it is very much up-to-date. People are getting brainwashed today. Yesterday, absolutely everybody believed in Global Warming and if you didn't you were an enemy. Then in a blink of an eye Global Warming mutated into Climate Change. Again, everybody believes in it. They don't understand it, but they believe in it. They don't question it. They no longer have an ability/brain power to do it. They blindly believe/trust someone who allegedly knows more. Some who have retained the ability to question are the enemies. How many scientist who dared to voice their disbelieve in Global Warming were booed down by their colleagues and had to quit?It is but one example.That's life, isn't it?"
1260,5,Fantastic book!!!,"Every happy little socialist should read this book! Orwell takes socialism of his day to the extreme, but today his veiw is not too far away. What's the differance between Hillary Clinton and Big Brother? The mustache.---This book is an amazing picture of mankind and a warning to all the people who want to steal the freedom from the individual(socialist)."
1261,1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"1984 by George Orwell, is the most BORING book I ever read for school. To me the plot was not interesting, the characters were useless and the time period .... Although the idea of the government controling everything is scary and most likely true it just didn't have any emotions to make it good. For a book to be good it needs to have emotions, and this book lacked them, and there was also no dialouge which to me is important.KNOT"
1262,1,"""classic"" does NOT mean good!!!","If you havent been forced to read this book while in school, or hadnt had a chance to grab it at the library, run while you can. 1984 might have been scary 100 years ago, but not now. If you like reading about old people think they are beating the system by saving a PAPERWEIGHT, then by all means...The book has multiple plot holes as well. Beware the ""government runs the world unchallenged, but still needs to brainwash old people"" hole. Read something else instead... ANYTHING ELSE!"
1263,4,Political Correctness Writ Large,"This is another must-read dystopia. I don't recommend it for children, however. It is quite frightening for anyone with an imagination. Avoid the Ministry of Love whatever you do! This book warns against the manipulation of people through twisting meaning truth=deception; love=destruction. Evil remains evil no matter what it is called, but evil is most dangerous when re-named."
1264,3,1984 The Good and Bad,"Orwell was a genius at forseeing future trends. He was also ingeneious at crafting the protrait of totalitarian control while using material from the media and political journals as his paint medium. His ability to take ""spin"" to its final conclusion with the term ""Newspeak"" is truly prophetic. The book is a warning cry for western civilization as it progresses to larger systems of government, and away from individual responsibility.On a somewhat negative side, are the main character, Winston's, interactions with and perceptions of some females in his society. While musing on the obviously ""politically-correct"" feminist female of the day, the author, through Winston, steps away from most readers by expressing contempt through Winston's desire to ""ravage the woman and strangle her at the moment of climax."" There are other graphic and sometimes repulsive descriptions of sexual escapades of the main character."
1265,3,Great condition,"The book was in perfect condition when I received it. It is an interesting read, but it was too long."
1266,5,One of my favortie novels ever!,"This book had a profound effect on me. It showed me how all thought is subjective, and showed me the fear of a totalitarian society. If you ever have the time of day, please read this book. And remember, two and two makes five..."
1267,3,1984 has come and gone...,"Orwell's ""1984"" is a classic piece of 20th century literature, no doubt. While I can see many things of which he speaks of in today's society (doublespeak, Big Brother, etc.), this book was not written as prophecy, as some might suggest. It should serve as a warning, nothing more.Instead, I'll say that I read it as required reading in a high-school literature class and found Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" to be a less heavy-handed approach to storytelling. I enjoyed ""1984"" only slightly more than the later film based upon the novel <yawn>."
1268,1,DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a ""classic"" but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."
1269,5,1984,"This is one of the most chilling books I have ever read because there is no escape and even Winston's dreams of the ""Golden Country"" are finally lost to him as Big Brother invades the last sanctuary--his mind and his soul."
1270,3,Really weird and hard to follow,"I was so lost when I first started reading this book. Orwell uses all these made-up words to describe ordinary things, and I couldn't remember them half the time. The very beginning was weird, and I didn't really understand what was happening. If we hadn't talked about it in my english class, I would still probably have no clue what it was about. There's a lot of symbolism that's really easy to miss, so it'd probably be better to not attack this one on your own. Wait until your class reads it, or your book club, or even just a few friends. Just don't try to figure everything out by yourself. If you do understand the book when you're done, you'll see that it was actually pretty interesting, and neat that Orwell, when he wrote it in 1948, actually had such advanced thoughts. Some parts are a little violent, and I don't really think there would be a point for anyone who's not in high school or older to read this book."
1271,4,A shocking book,"I think I recall reading this in highschool, but of course, did not realize it's value at the time. Upon reading it 20 years later, I was amazed! This was a very shocking book in that when it was written there was no way the author could have known what would have been invented or happening in our present time or in 1984. It reads like fiction, but we know it is reality. He sheds light on many events that are already in motion, even though government may not make it official to the public. This book is a warning of just how terrible life could be if we continue to be blinded by what we are told by the media; how truth is distorted by the deliverer and their masters and how humans will ultimately destroy themselves for the sake of power if allowed to do so. Of course history does repeat itself, I hope that will be proven incorrect."
1272,4,What If?,"What if there was someone watching your every move? For Winston Smith, this was a reality. A radical political party, simply called the Party, had taken control of life in Oceania. Its citizens had no choice but to mindlessly follow the reign of terror. Winston and his lover, Julia, banded together to secretly revolt against the Party's authority. Orwell's 1984 is a disturbing warning, forcing people to examine the freedoms they take for granted. This book is a haunting shadow of what may have been. Although the novel was lengthy, it is interesting, thought-provoking, and worth the time. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy taking a closer look at themselves and their own society."
1273,3,Important read for the times,Found this to be somewhat appropo for the times in which we live. A stark warning of things to come.
1274,4,Awsome made up world type of book.,"I read 1984 for a book report. It is really interesting and doesn't make you bored. It is kind of disapointing in the end, but it is the most creative book i have ever read. Im 14 and i really enjoyed this book."
1275,5,1984,This is an incredible book. I was very impressed with how well it is written and amazed that someone in the mid 40's was able to come up with such futuristic ideas and almost shocked at how much of it pertains to the realities of life. I loved every word of it and was almost sad that it was over.
1276,5,"My ""1984"" Review","I think that the book ""1984"", written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions. It was a book about a man fighting for his rights only to fine out he had to give in a bit. ""1984"" was a book that captured me into its story and I couldn't stop reading. I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"
1277,1,Garbage and other phrases...,"Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."
1278,3,Too popular for propaganda,This book is propaganda and is still used as such. I see it as new wave literature not as our English teachers see it a comment on totalitarianism. If your going to argue about the Soviet Union with me in all seriousness I would expect you too have lived there not be someone like the author a British Intelligence Officer. Why read biased junk? Mind you I find the romance in this story to be good so rate it 3 stars. Did this book introduce me to torture? I think it might have.
1279,5,Definitely one of the beast books that I have ever read.,"This book is skillfully written, intrusting, and entertaining. It is not a difficult read, but is not oversimplified in its language, and despite being written in 1949 the story and language do not seam dated (this, I consider it worth noting is the opinion of a high school student, who read this book voluntarily, rather than for school.) The books image of life in a society, that is an example of a communist society as it is most commonly perceived, though is certainly not a society that follows the equality based principals of communism (no 'communist' nation ever has). The story, in summery, is definitely worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. (Worth is that I read, and liked, Animal farm, though I do not consider it to be nearly so good a book as 1984. I would recommend that to anyone as young as 12, due to the simplicity of its language."
1280,4,The Erich Fromm afterword is outdated,"This book is a classic, and should be read by everyone claiming to be literate.The good thing about this particular version is that it's relatively inexpensive, and doesn't have a lot of extra material.The bad part about this particular version is that the afterword, written by Erich Fromm in 1961, has been overtaken by events. Communism has been exposed as an unethical, immoral system, and I am offended by Fromm's suggestion of some kind of moral equivalence between capitalism and communism.There needs to be a new afterword, written sometime after the World Trade Center attacks. It would actually be nice to have two small afterwords, written by people on different sides of the political aisle."
1281,5,Nineteen Eighty-Four,"George Orwell depicts a horrible totalitarian state that suppresses all opposition. In 1984 the world is divided into three parts, Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. These three parts are constantly at war. The charismatic figure of Big Brother stands in the forefront of the Party. It is a figure of mythical power. Winston Smith struggles against the Party, he rebels against Big Brother and the totalitarian regime. But his rebellion will result in his own destruction. We should bare in mind that this novel was published in 1949 and we so realise that Orwell's imaginary future world is a brilliant creation, his vision of brutalised and manipulated humanity is gripping and unfortunately still supremely relevant."
1282,5,Greatest Book Ever,"Why are you even spending time to read reviews of this book. Any educated individual should read this masterpiece. What a book, what an ending, what does our future really hold?"
1283,5,It will rock you!,"There should be no doubt Orwell's ""1984"" is the gold standard for dystopian novels. It's about a Totalitarian society that exists in the future from when it was originally published in 1949 (certainly in our future as well). It's popularly believed the inspiration for ""1984"" came from Yevgeny Zamyatin's ""We"", first published in 1924, and there are similarities. Also, the suggestion, by others, that it's the direction that current politics are leading the U.S. is no doubt contributing to the story's renewed popularity. No matter the reasons, this story is frightening and depressing, but also a testament to the survivability of the human spirit. Prepare yourself though, ""1984"" will, without question, provide you a terrifying glimpse in a world bereft of personal freedom.I'd forgo the foreword by Thomas Pynchon though. Read it, if you must, after you finish reading ""1984""."
1284,5,One of the Greatest Novels of All Time,"""1984"" is recognized to be one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, and helped to expose the evil that is contained in totalitarianism. The only fear is that in a post cold war existence we may fail to remember the lessons Orwell taught us, and unexpectedly in our complacency we may allow that evil to rise again."
1285,1,"Verisimilitude, people!","I say the book is unrealistic, but that's not what I mean. It's not that his characters couldn't exist. It's more a problem of verisimilitude -- that is, he states the problem, and THEN HE DEVIATES FROM IT! The populace in 1984 -- they're supposed to be much like his ""modern people"" of '48. But it's just too darn blatant to make it seem real. And why is good ol' ""common man"" Winston disbelieving? It's thoroughly improbable. I realize he was talking about communism, but communism was a great deal subtler than that. It's nowhere near the realistic depictions of the future by science-fiction writers, but because the science-fiction writers weren't respected, and Orwell was a Prominent Social Critic, look what we're stuck with -- the paranoid fevered dream of a madman masquerading as a prophet."
1286,5,High school English teacher,"I am a second year high school English teacher and I just read this book for the first time because I loved Animal Farm and I am now trying to figure out a way to talk my district into including it in the curriculum.I am not a very political person (I don't even vote), but this is a very interesting read about a society that never existed, but is coming very close to emerging: a society in which someone is ALWAYS watching (think reality TV mixed with Bush's phone taps).If you have never read this book, do yourself a favor and pick it up."
1287,2,Cleverly imaginative yet unbearingly boring,"As a summer reading assignment, I was assigned this book to read and appreciated Orwell's sense of imagination. I reccomend this novel to anyone who is interested in the world of make believe. People who appreciate descriptive writing will certainly enjoy reading this novel. However, this novel will probably not appeal to people who enjoy novels that tell stories. I found the novel extremely boring because it is all about Orwell's vision of an unstable society, it does not give the reader the desire to read on."
1288,2,I've never thought about the affects of a book quite so much,"Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it."
1289,2,School Book review,"I read the book 1984 by George Orwell for my book report in school. This is a book targeted for an older audience than an eighth grader. Its main theme, I believe, is that we cannot let our government have too much power. The government is controlling the peoples' lives with a fist as tight as possible. If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head. It used ""Newspeak,"" past experiences, and things that just didn't make any sense to to me. I understand that most people really enjoyed this book. Maybe when I get older I will uderstand it more."
1290,2,"Great story, poor Kindle rendition","Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the ""Kindle edition"" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."
1291,5,How can we have enthusiasm to grow if we see no wrong?,"BRAVO! This is my all-time favorite book. Its wonderfully intriguing and sophisticated plot sparks intelligent thought, reexamination of our society, and serves as a warning for our future. This book should be on the ""Human Required Reading List"" anyway becasue of the every day references to Big Brother and other common analogies. Be prepared to be amazed by the power of the mind!"
1292,5,I love George Orwell,"I read this book 5 years ago for an English book report. I've never been able to forget it. It's the haunting account of Winston Smith, an employee of the Ministry of Truth who hasn't forgotten the past, and who wants to change the future.However, Big Brother is watching him. Try as he might, our hero is trapped in a totalitarian world where he faces extermination if he wants to think as an individual and question the government.Published in 1949 during the Cold War, Orwell puts a spin on communism and totalitarianism that to this day makes my blood run cold. I shutter at the thought of our world ever becoming like Oceania, even in the slighest bit.Highly recommended book for the whole world to read. Let's hope we never come to this."
1293,4,"If you read it years ago, try listening this time...","This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did."
1294,4,Hauntingly relevant,"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."
1295,4,1984--Great book--bad ending.,"I recently chose to read this book as an assignment for my english class. I've always heard that it is such a great piece of literature, so naturally I wanted to experience it. At the beginning of the novel, I was taken in by the way Orwell starts describing Oceania. Then he goes into describe how the party uses telescreens to watch everything that is done by members of the party. These as long as many other elements of the story were very intriguing and are what kept me reading to the end. For the most part, I greatly enjoyed this book, but I would have been happier if the ending was different."
1296,2,"Maybe Big Brother will hate me, but...","I think this is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.The idea of it and the detail put into it is admirable, but it lacks that special 'something' that can make such serious/scary subject-matter hold my attention.I can understand the importance of the story, but Winston Smith wasn't a character I cared for or found any interest in whatsoever. And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."
1297,5,A Must Read for Literary Fiction Fans,"Amazing. The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read. Again and again."
1298,2,1984,"I read this book back in the '60's and seeing the events unfolding with the election of Obama, I wanted to see how much of Orwell's prediction are coming to fruition...starting with the BIG SCREEN TV's and now ""drones"" being used over American air space...scary!The book itself is rather slow reading (haven't finished)written in the 1st person with attention to details so very good for the imaginative mind. Still curious as to the outcome as I forgot the ending. More when completed.Would I recommend this book? depends, but not for everyone...I liked reading ""The Help"" better with the character interactions..."
1299,1,Book was not trimmed,The first copy of the book I received was not trimmed along the long side making it very difficult to turn the pages. I returned the book and received another one the next day (BTW Amazon's replacement policy is great and their customer service is awesome as well). The second copy of the book I received was also not trimmed along the long side. I was refunded for the book and purchased it elsewhere.
1300,3,"Classic, but dull","I thought that 1984 was a pretty good book, except that I think it would have been better if I would have read it before 1984. The begining was dull and kind of boring, but I thought that ending was pretty good. I recomend it because it shows what could happen in the future if the government ever got a lot of power."

1302,5,Absolute stunner,"Many people have already written down the plot of this movie. many people understood the plot of the movie. Many people didn't understand the plot of this movie.This is a hell of a ride. With every next scene you are scared what will be next. But you want, NO you need to see it. Isabella Huppert is amazing and probably has givin the performance of the year. All the acting in this movie is magnificent. Many of the american reviewers don't seem to understand the bigger picture, as if sexual violence is of a worse kind then plain killing with a gun and shooting people in the streets. Knowing how puritan USA is as a country I believe that many people have difficulties seeing al the layers in this movie. There are so many, watch it again and maybe you will see the true art in this film."
1303,4,Prepare yourself,"I was originally attracted to this film because I am/was a pianist and I was interested to see a French take on a movie involving a musician.Wow... upon first viewing, I was quite shocked. There are some scenes in this movie that are downright disturbing. If you've seen any French film, you may know what to expect. If you haven't, this may not be the right film to start with. Ultimately, it was very well acted and well directed. The special features aren't enormous, but what is there is quite interesting, including an interview with Isabelle Huppert.It's hard to describe, really. If you're used to American film, you probably won't like it right away. Give it a chance. If you don't like it, that's fine."
1304,3,Spending time with a tortured soul.,"I like dark movies. This movie. Is a dark movie. I may have given the review just 3 stars but it is only for the many, many questions I had at the end of the film. The one thing I have trouble understanding is the true reason of why the piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert) is the way she is. You can say out of nowhere, oh she was molested or raped when she was young or something but the movie never ever shows any flashbacks or reveal any true thoughts or opinions of her nature from her own point of view. The good job done by this movie is making the viewer a 'voyeur' into this woman's situation as she struggles with a man and her own mother. Another good reason why I liked the film is because of the ending. I just remember feeling so cold and depressed from the ending becuase it was something that I did not expect to happen at all. Personally this movie gave me a jilt and if your into ever watching foreign films than I recommend The Piano Teacher."
1305,3,"Interesting, but not ""the truth""...","Will this video reveal the truth behind the origins of Nazism? Of course not. The rise of the Nazis was the result of a complex and unique set of social and political factors, of which occultism and the workings of secret societies was but a small part. The existence and activities of the so-called Vril Society is based largely on conjecture, it's influence and significance largely a matter of (mis)interpretation. While certainly interesting to watch, needless to say such a production always has an ulterior motive: to make money. Conspiracy/alternative history, after all, has become a lucrative industry."
1306,2,Doen't fit to DCR-PC55,"This battery, NP-FA70, is not compatible with Sony DCR-PC55 camcorder. It won't fit into the camcorder. The battery DCR-PC55 uses is the NP-FA50.The information about the battery is misleading. It states that NP-FA70 is compatible with DCR-55, which is not correct. This battery is thicker than NP-FA50 and does not fit into DCR-55's battery bay."
1307,2,He isn't what I remember.,"The CD isn't what I remember about Liberace. He was a great performer and showman. On this CD , there is very little of his solo piano music. Very little grand piano type music at all. Most of what you do get is overshadowed by the background music. I was disapointed."
1308,2,Unbelievable,"This is a politically-correct Broadway play set to film. It fails utterly. Guinness is badly miscast, looking about as Japanese as, say, Robert Morley. Rosalind Russell is barely plausible as a Jewish mother. The movie lacks wit, humor, sophistication, action, and suspense. It's basically a soap opera with lots of preaching about the brotherhood of man (oops, humankind). It's no surprise to me that the film has not been released on DVD. No one needs to waste time like that. Put this one in your Turkey book."
1309,2,BUYERS BEWARE! BOOTLEG OFFERING,"This film has not been issued on DVD. This listing was created by a bootlegger, selling home-made copies."
1310,5,Majority of One,"I love this movie!! It is very special to me! I was fascinated with this movie and with Japan from an early age! This movie was actually my introduction to Japan decades ago. Then I ended up majoring in Japanese in college and living in Japan. Now I am writing a review of this movie sitting in Kawasaki, Japan... A very sweet movie... with famous actors... not without its ""unpolitically correct"" moments, that were accepted decades ago, but nevertheless a very sweet movie that shows how people who care about one another don't think about language barriers or differences in nationality. Love Love Love it!!"
1311,2,Somebody Gotta Put You Back Into Yo Place!,"This CD set is false advertising. On the box it says over 3 hours of tracks, but none of the CDs lasts over an hour. That, and the fact that it appears like it was made by some amateur over the Web with various soundbytes snipped together (I'm exaggerating) are my biggest complaints.Only some of the tracks are even worth listening to. At first I found the dialogue somewhat fascinating, but it quickly faded into trite without much replay value. And beware, for some of the tracks are not even Beatle-related, it's just music from that time period.And I'm a big Beatles fan. My favourite albums are the White Album & Abbey Road."
1312,3,can't read with these,The prescription is fine for the glasses but they are too small of an area to work with. I have to move my head around in the lenses to see read anything. They are not for everyone. If they made the reader lenses larger they would get a 5 star but as they are now I can only give them a 3 star rating. If they have a good return policy to get what you need I would pay more for the right ones.
1313,1,0 STARS: Total GARBAGE!!,"This is one sorry, cheap, low-budget and total garbage of a so-called horror flick! I mean the acting is atrocious in this thing!!!! This is a very poor and total disgrace of an addition to the slasher sub-genre!!! What a sad day it is for the horror genre when trash like this is made, let alone actually sold to any innocent victim! I can't say enough about how sorry this movie is. ""Tower of Blood"" is just pure rubbish!!The movie follows a familiar script, typical slasher flick format, but the acting is so bad, the film is so poorly executed and the movie is just so completely lacking in style that even the the most unsophisticated of horror movie fans will just laugh or cry (depending on how much you paid for it) after watching this trash. This is total amateuristic rubbish and is not worth a penny!"
1314,1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!,I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. I plugged this in and waited almost 20min with a screaming baby and the formula was almost as cold as it was when I started. Huge waste of money!!!1
1315,1,Didn't warm at all!!,"It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!"
1316,2,A harlequin romance set a sex club,"I found this book to be rather silly. Never mind that the protagonists work at sex club, they are just two crazy kids in love. If you want to read a traditional romance novel where the character's pasts as S and M enthusists are hinted at, this is your book. I was trully surprised at how convential this book was and expected more from Ann Rice. The ending was particularly silly and Harlequin-esq."
1317,3,"Slick, entertaining, ultimately conformist","The novel was kind of groundbreaking in its time in that it took subject matter (BDSM) that until that time had been completely hidden in more or less underground publications. It was written with commercial slickness, a quality that is sometimes off-putting in Rice's work. The characters are basically sympathetic. Ultimately, the novel is not as subversive as it would like to be taken for, suggesting that the characters will only be happy once they escape their alternative sexual practices. It doesn't give this impression unequivocally yet there is a linger whiff of conformism in this book despite the subject matter."
1318,2,Only if you liked the Movie,"If you have watch the film based on this novel more then once, then you'll find this book an interesting read. As usual film is very different from the novel, but this only makes it a good read if you are into S & M.Spoiler warning.Many of you probably want to read the chapter when Lisa was having sex Elliot. This is very different from the movie. In the novel Lisa is ""doing him""."
1319,2,Needs more to it.,"I like to read erotic fiction from time to time. But if it doesn't have substance, it's nothing more than another trashy pornography novel. ""Eden"" was better than Anne's "" Beauty"" novels, but was definitely not for readers who want the zest they received from "" Interview with the Vampire""."
1320,2,Trashy,"I picked up this title based on the recommendation of a friend, and I have to say I was rather disappointed. I expected Ann Rice to be a virtuoso. She turned out to be a hack with an anal fixation. The dialogue and narration is only slightly better written than Penthouse letters, and the effect is less erotic. The only reason I rated the book as high as I did is because it read quickly, so at least I didn't waste a lot of time getting through it."
1321,2,Not her best work.,"I have read many of Anne Rice's books, including the books on the lives of the Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles, and have loved every one. However, I was not impressed with Exit to Eden. I felt like the passion and literary talent evident in Anne Rice's writings was totally absent. I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here."
1322,2,some books suffer from abridgement,"The abridgement of this otherwise wonderfully delightful and wickedly sensual book is a huge disappointment. There was little of the drama nor the depth of character found in the actual novel. I read this book years ago and found it quite profound. The tape, which barely last 1.5 hours covers none of the motivation, the anticipation nor the quality of Rice's intentions for placing the characters in this specific situation and performing these activities. Incredibly shallow reading by both actors, also."
1323,3,Great Book,"This is a great storybook, fosters the imagination of my little girls. Fantastic illustrations, great to linger on each page...Ordered a ""like new"" copy which was filled with scribbles. Kind of disappointing, but not that big of a deal."
1324,1,The title gives it away,"A dictator ?? You gotta be kidding. Ataturk is the reason Turkish people have democracy, women's equality, and a secular government. Without this 'dictator' they would be still in the stone ages. The 'author' has NO understanding of the Turkish and Ottoman history."
1325,3,"Good, but not chocolate bar good","ok, so I'm not going to bash, these are my first protein bars, ever, so I have nothing to compare it to. I was expecting the worse and I was pleasantly surprised. I will say that are are filling, and give me the protein I'd want from a health food bar. The chocolate taste: haven't quite put my finger on it. initially I thought raspberry or even acai...but now I'm thinking it's probably the flax seeds? it's not bad, it's just not a milk chocolate taste, that some of these other reviewers are claiming could rival candy bars. I didn't encounter an aftertaste others have described. It is dense, but is that bad or good for health bars? beats me. I just couldn't imagine having coffee or tea with these. Way too rich to be accompanied with anything other than water, maybe milk. I will definitely finish this box as I find at 3pm they are really helpful."
1326,1,Wrong book,"wrong book sent. Customer service was poor and presented an extremely difficult procedure for correcting the problem. I was required to pay to send the book back, mailing back cost almost as the book itself. Even complying with this process did not ensure a replacement, but only that the order would be checked."
1327,4,The similarities between the the book and our world are amaz,"I enjoyed the book very much and would definitly recomend it to others. It is very fast paced and the action starts right from the begining of the book. The plot is very interesting because of the similarities between Ray's world and ours. If you like futurist books or even books about our world, and science fiction, this is definitly a great book."
1328,3,Time to cool off and drop a few degrees,"The book Fahrenheirt 451 was a book that could use a lot of work. The author talks about burning books. Now if burning books is the type of book you like to read about then this is the perfect book for you. While reading this book you will learn about censorship and how important it is in socity today. Guy Montag who was the main character has issues weather burning books is good or not, although he is one of the firemen who burns the books. The book kind of deals with a reality check for the communtiy which if you read the book find out it doesn't turn out to well."
1329,4,Classic Bradbury,"One of the top 100 books of all time per ""readers,"" this little book was beyond prophetic. Bradbury's writing creates a world that the reader easily accepts as real. This kindle version had a few distracting typo's - hence the 4 star rating."
1330,4,rays story,"well in gerneral I think that Is a good story and it is hard to understand. Im not a bright guy but it was hard for me to understand, but the parts that I did I liked it. It could have had a better ending."
1331,4,appreciation,"The author of the book Fahrenheit 451 was focused on teaching appreciation of God-given rights to his readers. Ray Bradbury considered a life without reading, without control of one's own thoughts, and without knowing history. He also considered a life where parents don't like the children that they have. Bradbury considered this and thought best to write a book so that people would not take their lives for granted. He considers reading a privilege, while most others would consider it a right, a right that isn't thought of as a right, but just is. Bradbury conveys a horrible story that helps his readers understand what they should value in life."
1332,2,ATTENTION TEACHERS!,"I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of ""show, don't tell""? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School. It's no wonder, with book selections like these, that students don't read and are illiterate."
1333,4,The Brain-Child of a Literary Lover,"Having met and seen Mr. Bradbury speak in person in the very location where he wrote this book out on type-writer, the Powell Library at UCLA, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the message this novel conveys. Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."
1334,5,best book ever,I love this book! i tried to read it when i was younger but couldnt understand it and when i read it all the way through a few years ago i feel in love. this book is so beautiful and hopeful even through all the darkness. Ray Bradbury is an amazing author and knows how to bring a story to life.
1335,3,"It was um, thought prevoking","Fahrenheit 451 was a book that had a very good message. This book made me think about where our society could be heading. It made me realize how important books are and how awful it would be if it was illegal to read! The only bad thing about this book is that there were many metaphores. Becuase there were so many metaphores I didn't always know if certain things were really happening or if he was just using figurative language. Despite this, the book was very good and made me think very hard about how important books really are."
1336,3,Finally getting 'round to it,"This is a book I had always meant to read - so when a 16 yr old I know had to read it for class I read it too. It's a quick, entertaining read. Nothing earth-shattering for adults, but I can see why it's recommended for high school (or even middle school) kids."
1337,2,Disappointed,"Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I tried and just couldn't get through this book. Perhaps I needed a teacher to help me get the symbolism!"
1338,3,Great little book,"The world the book depicts is so far from reality that it was a good distraction. I'm sure there were many times in the past, history could have taken a wrong turn & many many books could have been lost. I am certainly glad that didn't really happen. I had an experience once in which I checked out a book titled ""Paganism"". I was just curious. All throught the book someone had written in pen that whoever reads the book is working w/the devil. I thought, ""isn't that special"". someone ruined a perfectly good book because of their religious beliefs. I showed the book to the librarian and she said she would use white out to fix it or order another book on Paganism."
1339,5,Frighteningly Prophetic,"Farenheit 451 tells about a future United States. Keep in mind, this was written some 40 years ago, but his predictions can be alarmingly accurate. Montag's society's obsession with t.v. is frighteningly prophetic, as is the obsession with dieting. Also, has anyone ever thought of the similarities between the recently popular laser-light shows and the White Clown show? I must say that the most frightening part of this novel is how everything begins to move faster and the thoughts of the individual are lost - something I see happening in today's society."
1340,4,Thought provoking read,"Ray Bradbury's last published book is a great thought provoking fantasy. What if we lived in a world where books were considered dangerous contraband and firemen weren't hired to put out but to start fires? We're already starting to experience news in shorter segments and everything's being reduced to soundbites. Will our attention span start to deteriorate to the extent that it is normal to only be able to focus for a few short minutes?Guy Montag is one such fireman whose wife subconsciously tries to commit suicide, and who after meeting a young neighbor, Clarisse, starts to think and question the world in which he lives. When he starts to steal and hide books in the walls of his house, he meets an old professor with whom he tries to formulate a plan to change the ruling regime who instill the fear of books among the population. But someone knows about his secret and soon Guy is on the run as a fugitive."
1341,3,It's Mediocre.,"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a mediocre quality book. It is rather easy to read (7th grade level) and is also easy to follow. The writing style is different because the culture is very different from anywhere today. The plot is also different due to books are banned in this world. This book is recommended to people who dislike books because this book shows the world without them, so those people may reconsider their opinions."
1342,4,I want more,"I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and feel like I did when someone gave me a shareware version of a video game. I learned the moves, became someone addicted, cleared the third level and found that I needed a code to get the rest of the game. Only Ray didn't give away the code to 451!This is clearly a fantastic story, horribly well written. I have wish listed several more of his books for future reading. Unfortunately 451 is long enough that you suspend some of the caveats used when reading short stories. With a book this long, I want developed characters to be resolved. Several characters just go away, which left me lacking at the end. Sometimes this is intended, and strong. In this case, it seemed thoughtless and abrubt.Don't miss the afterword and coda at the end. Very nice additions."
1343,4,Great book,This was a book I had read in high school and really enjoyed. I thought this would make a great addition to my library at home.
1344,3,Realizing the Relevance in The Real World.,"This book foretells our future by describing advances in technology. The scary part is how close we are. The sea shell radio can be portrayed as teenagers and their headphones. Mildred and the gals might as well be the stereotypical women who are having a tough relationship week; the ones who watch chick flicks with a tub of ice cream all week end. If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books. Not one of those books with descriptive features you might miss and want to read again for, or characters you can adore, or even events you would be on the edge of your seat to read."
1345,1,All books begin with a premise...,"... and this one also ended there. Compared to Orwell's 1984 and similar works, this novel is teen romance. It light-heartedly bounds through what it likes to think is a dark future. With all respect to the esteemed Mr. Bradbury, it reads more like Futurama.Aldous Huxley and George Orwell both cover this subject in much greater detail and provide a deeper sense of the darkness of our future. The themes of ignorance, gleeful mass-media mesmerism and inner conflict are better represented in their works.If you understand doublespeak, give this one a miss. It's double-plus-ungood."
1346,3,later delivery than usual,I was in a hurry to get this book for a class project for my daughter. Ordered it and waited and waited for its arrival. Much longer shipping time than other books I had ordered on internet... I checked the book out of the library and read it while waiting.
1347,5,Excellent story that portrays the affect that censorship and brainwashing can have on society,"Beautifully written, Fahrenheit 451 is set in an era where firemen create fires to burn forbidden books; books are after all evil. Guy Montag questions everything he has known, challenges the status quo and the result is an excellent story that portrays the affect that censorship and brainwashing can have on society."
1348,3,A good book to get into and think!,"This book really makes you think and most of the things that are in this book about teens and technology is coming true in our world today, kinda scary."
1349,2,My Review,"This book was very interesting, but I wouldn't consider it a Sci-Fi. It takes place in the future, and firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Its about a fireman named Montag who starts to question the law that says you are not aloud to have books, and his adventure after. It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six. It was a very creative story, but I am not a fan of many futuristic books. Kids under the sixth grade should not read this because they may get confused or not understand some of the words in the book."
1350,2,OK,The book was not that bad-but i wouldn't strongly recommend it. It was a bit weird for my liking.
1351,2,Sadly a disappointment,"Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did."
1352,2,Overrated,"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."
1353,3,Great concept,"The premises of Fahrenheit 451 are promising: the ever looming ""this-could-happen"" is enacted out in the form of Guy Montag and his little world where people desire only 4 screen televisions in their parlour, where advertising reigns supreme, etc. A vast majority of books are illegal because they inspire conflict (the Koran and the Bible, Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto) with conflicting ideas. Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better. So, read it, just for the sake of reading it, but don't expect a huge masterpiece."
1354,5,a classic,When I first heard of the basic plot in which Firemen burn books rather than putting out fires I was a little skeptical. I was most definitely mistaken. This prophetic short story was engrossing. There is nothing I can say which hasn't been said before. Yes the underlying themes aren't so underlying but they are multilayered and provide a buffet of ideas to feast upon.
1355,4,A good read,"I think that this book is a very interesting book because it has some very interesting characters. For instance Mildred, I think that she is a very brainwashed characte. My favorite part in this book would have to be when Montag is outrunning society. I like it because it shows in great detail what Guy is feeling, and seeing."
1356,2,The message is good but...,"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."
1357,3,This book is a little too far out,"Not being a avid science fiction reader, I was not as fond of this book as many of my peers were. I thought this book seemed a little to ""far out"" compared to what I am used to in a book. Although I found this book somewhat akward, I do still find it an alright book and well written, that is why this book is awarded three stars."
1358,2,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."
1359,3,This book gave me a headache.,"The prose of this book confused me a great deal. That's why I had trouble understanding the plot. All of Ray Bradbury's books do that to me. And even though I'm only 13, I love to read. I read Watership Down in 1 day, and loved it. There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read. It's the language that confuses me. This book could have been good if the language had more clarity. It has an inventive, thought-provoking storyline. TV might actually be taking over our lives. It's true in the real world."
1360,3,This book gave me a headache.,"The prose of this book confused me a great deal. That's why I had trouble understanding the plot. All of Ray Bradbury's books do that to me. And even though I'm only 13, I love to read. I read Watership Down in 1 day, and loved it. There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read."
1361,3,"Great message, but confusingly presented.","Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a meaningful tale ofthe consequences of removing opinion, choice, andconflict from our world. The message is a powerfulone that will provoke and frighten the reader. The""fantasy"" world created by Bradbury bears a strikingresemblance to our own. However, I was confused bythe loaded metaphors and symbolism. Some createdvivid pictures, but others did not make any sense. Itwas often difficult to distinguish between themetaphors and actual events happening in the story.I appreciate Bradbury's message, but I feel that I mayhave missed some important comparisons andclarificatons. I hope that you do not."
1362,5,How could you give it less than five stars?,"When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was ""Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest."" Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."
1363,4,Fahrenheit 451,This was a great book because it shows they world where you can not think on your own and decide on your own. Life would be different if there were no book and where the government thinks for you.
1364,2,Read it only for school,"I had to read this book for school, and I really didn't like it. There were good parts, but there was a lot of wasted words in other parts. I was very surprised that some of the bad events were in great detail and the ok parts were not. I hated the bad parts because they were so disgusting to read. I am only 12 and I think this book is better for mature readers. This book had a great theme, but a lot of the not so important events could have been taken out. If you are a mature reader and like science fiction, you will probably like this book."
1365,2,"The book is very boring and in some parts,doesn't make sense","This book just plain doesn't make sense and it doesn't apply to younger people. Even though many schools have made this book a standard for 9th and 10th graders to read, many of us just don't understand and get lost. We understand about censorship and all that other stuff, but why are you telling us? We are the ones that want to make everything more open. You make us read this book, like we are the ones trying to close everything up and prevent us from reading anything. I think the congress men and all adults should read this. Not kids. I personally think that teachers and educators could have picked a better book for us students to read. But that is my opinion, and suprisely many fellow students agree with me."
1366,3,Better than expected,I thought this book was pretty good but not the best book I have ever read. Some parts were really good and I couldn't put it down but there were to many parts that were really boring. This book was about a society that couldn't have books because they made to many people unhappy and it was said they were full of garbage. Firefighters started fires to get rid of books instead of getting fires out. This book was confusing at parts but it wasn't to bad. I wouldn't recommend this to people have a hard time reading confusing books because you won't be able to finish. All around this was a pretty good book and it is worth it to read.
1367,3,Too simplistic.,"there were parts of this book I enjoyed, but overall it is not a classic piece of literature. He's way too heavy-handed in his treatment of the material. The writing is just average. A good example is when he returns to the firehouse the night his wife turns him in. they get a call and it turns out to be his own house. It was obvious from the beginning that they would be ending up at his house (I thought), but to describe it Bradbury writes: ""Why,"" said Montag slowly,""we've stopped in front of *my* house"". I can think of a hundred other ways to convey that information that would have been more subtle, more elegant, more surprising. Be he hit's us over the head. It's like bad TV. Cut to comercial..."
1368,1,A Very Dark and Mysterious Book,"I first read this book for an English assignment at school. After reading the first few pages I was completely lost. Bradbury expresses a world far different from ours which can seem scary and unrealistic. It is very easy to get caught up in all the different things that happen and it is hard to get into the mood of the plot. Definetly not the greatest book in the world. Personally, I hated the book."
1369,5,my review,this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today
1370,2,What the heck?,"This movie is weird to say the least. Over all picture quality, at least on the version we have, is pretty poor for DVD. It is more like an old VHS rental or something. Sound is average at best. The movie, or movies as it is, are rather confusing. The action seems to bounce all over the place and it is not entirely clear as to what is going on most of the time. The general idea of the movie (e.g. God and Satan bartering over souls) is interesting but this movie does not pull it off very well. The only thing that keeps it remotely interesting are the short parts with gore that is so fake and funny you end up laughing your ass off (clay animation anyone?). I'd definately recommend renting this movie if possible before considering a purchase."
1371,4,Could this really happen?,"A great read w/a uncomfortably plausible story line. Just the fact that children could be used as pauns by terrorism is terrorfying in itself. This book is well written and the characters well developed. Interesting twist throughout the book and a good, ending. Well worth the read and looking forward to more books from this writer."
1372,5,Every senior should get this book!,Purchased this book for my high school senior daughter to help her write those dreaded college essays. Great info with lots of tips to get the ideas flowing for topics. Highly recommend!
1373,2,ludwig,Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.
1374,4,Not The Same Ol' Blues,"Mem's not leaving the blues behind. He's taking them somewhere else! And the blues need to be taken elsewhere. Mr. Shannon is the best thing that's ever happened to contemporary blues. He's left all the stale cliches behind and taken a fresh approach. Mem has an abundance of talent and intelligence and he puts it to good use writing fresh lyrics relevant to the times. He's also one hell of a guitar player! From the gorgeous nylon string solo (how many other blues guitarists play a classical guitar?) on The Lights Of Caracas, to the ultra funky and inventive playing on We Going, Mem sounds inspired! He plays with a beautiful clean tone which is refreshing to these ears. Mem doesn't just play blues guitar licks like many unimaginative players, he plays music. There is much to like on this release as well as all of Mem's cds. If you've grown tired of the same 'ol blues, pick up a Mem Shannon cd. You'll be revitalized!"
1375,4,Cheap price good product,My parents use this and it's made by motorola. No issues with it what so ever
1376,4,It's Inexpensive and it Works,"I own two of these chargers, which even with shipping charges are a fraction of the cost of those available in retail stores...even discount stores...and I don't see any difference between the performance of these and the expensives ones."
1377,4,Car adapter for Motorola Razr - ok with me,Not much to say about it. It works and that's all I care about. Well worth the couple bucks!
1378,4,A GREAT GAME FOR ADVENTURE LOVERS!,"This game is full of action. The graphics are really cool! Through out the game you will meet enemies. When you find them you will have to fight them. You can choose to be any of these characters: Frodo,Samwise,Pippin,Gandalf,Legolas,Gimli and Aragorn. All of these characters have there own unique power. My favourite character is Legolas, he is so cool!!Attention all costomers this makes a great gift!!yours truly,your reviewer***"
1379,2,battle weary,"This game is horrible. The battles are so... long, slow and unexciting. The scenery is cute, but alittle dark for GBA.Don't waste your money."
1380,4,"Hey give it some credit, listen to me.","So far this game hasn't received any credit, well not much.To start off the graphics are good, and the sound is good too.I haven't seen one glitch yet, I'm sorry. The battles are some what slow, but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping items. If you find glitches, return your game! My game is fine, and I'm past Moria. You can switch your characters, that is a really cool option. But the osund goes away in battles sometimes, thats not so fun. I like to have energy in my battles, but the battles are slow. That's why this game got a 7 out of 10. O' and I'm 14 years old, I'm just not signed up with Amazon. Fun game for younger kids.GRAPHICS: 8 out of 10SOUND: 6 out of 10GAMEPLAY: 7 out of 10OVERALL: 7 out of 10"
1381,4,Its amazing but difficult. (i need help),"Look, the game its amazing.In the old forest you must go always right to go to the tree,always left to go to a secret place,always down to go to a man,and always up to go to a house.But i'm in the mines of moria now and i need some help.I was in a door but i cant move and push start neither.If someone who did pass the mines of moria is reeding this , i need you to tell me how to pass the mines, please."
1382,4,Horrible!,"Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!"
1383,1,A Bad Video Game,"Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."
1384,2,Ok game,"This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf."
1385,2,Book is better than the movie,"I really liked the book, that is why I got this DVD. Big mistake. The acting is so bad, it reminds me of those cheesy after school specials where it seems like they just pulled people off the streets and said ""here's the script, do the best you can"". I have several of Mary Higgins Clark's DVDs. It is pretty much hit and miss as to whether or not the acting will be good or not. You're better off renting them."
1386,5,Great movies for kids!,"I found this two boxed VHS set at Marshall's for 5.99, brand new, so the asking price here it way too high, but the movies are wonderful for both kids and parents alike. I have a three year old and he is crazy about Stuart Little. You can't go wrong with these films!"
1387,1,Not what was pictured,Speed square that is pictured has black outline on all lettering. What I recieved has no outlining on lettering. Very hard to read. Very disappointed in product.
1388,5,Cop movie.,"Most police flicks are told from the prospective of white police officers. This one is told from a different view. The prologue is very true and not often spoken about. Overall, a good movie."
1389,3,Lacked subtitles,"The amazon ad suggested Colin Firth was in more of the movies -- but he's only in one.Biggest problem: no subtitles, and we find the Brits hard to understand.If it had subtitles, we'd rate it a 4 or 5 star."
1390,2,Love british movies,"But I had already seen some of this movie on Netflix, and did not realize until I had purchased this movie"
1391,3,disappointed,I am disappointed that there are no closed captions. My husband cannot watch these movies with me because he is hard of hearing.
1392,3,great service,"Great service it really was; but the movies, oh not so good very slow and boring. I was disapointed and had hoped for better."
1393,2,Inconsistent and not Family Friendly,"Be aware that while the best known of these is sweet PG rated film and one is listed as Dove approved, others are PG-13 & R rated and filled with nudity and crudity. A disappointment."
1394,3,8 Acclaimed Films,I trusted British Cinema too much with this one.Actor's names will pull me. One forgettable onewas disturbing probably because of the immorality.
1395,3,Problem to record Video in my camcorder,"I was able to record any video produced with Ulead Video or Adobe Premier using the IEEE 1394 port using another 1394 card I had installed.When I installed this new card, I removed my old 1394 card to use the new 1394 port included in the ati radeon 8500 dv card.Now I can capture video without problems, but, when I try to record video to my camcorder using Ulead Video or Adobe Premier, is not working.The answer from ATI support is that the firewire port (1394) is for input only."
1396,2,Cute but OUCH!,"I buy Clarks for the comfort and instant wearability, but I was so disappointed with these! I wore them around the house for a couple of days, hoping I'd be able to break them in, but eventually the skin on the back of my ankle and the sides of my feet (where the little strap crosses over) was rubbed off and bleeding. I decided to return them. I'll buy Clarks shoes again, but these were not good!"
1397,2,same,"Certain songs from naglfar are without a doubt outstanding esp. ""12th rising"", ""brimstone gate"", but the songs off of Vittra all sound similar. I can't really decipher between them. Most of the riffs aren't capturing. It is hard to find the cd Diabolical which has the songs i mentioned above but already I can tell you that cd is better than Vittra."
1398,2,SQUEKY SPRINGS,In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.
1399,3,Not for use with Multi-Media Cards,"I purchased this with my Kodak DX3215 camera (which I love) because the tech support staff at Amazon assured me that it would work with multi-media card too. It does not.So the good people at Amazon Customer Support (I love them) promptly sent me a return ticket for it. Pity, though. I had called tech support just so that Amazon could be spared the expense of just such an event.And guess what? It turns out that I don't even need a media reader at all, because that's what the DX3215's docking station does beautifully for me anyway.However, I do agree that you should buy this if your digital camera lacks its own docking base, because its a great time saver."
1400,1,Snake Oil,"The Digital Media Reader may work well with Windows 98,Me or 2000, but it failed miserably with XP. To add insult to injury when the SimpleTech web site was queried; mis-information was the best they could give.During the hardware installation, the media reader(UCS-200) did not pass the Windows Logo Testing. I immediately aborted the process. I went to the Simpletech web site for advice. SimpleTech had a section just for XP and stated,"" just ignore Windows's warning and complete the setup process"".What a mistake I made, my operating system was degraded and became unstable. Until I'm able to recover from this misfortune, my computer shuts down whenever and frequent.The news of bad and mis-leading service will spread exponentially from person to person. I hope that this is the exception and not the rule for SimpleTech.Because of wrong information from the SimpleTech web site, I can not recommend a SimpleTech Product in the future."
1401,3,Great games but very few,"All in all this disc offers everything an 80's aficionado would want. As a kid who grew up in the 80's i tend to lean towards arcade games that come from my generation. Its often hard to find a Galaga in good working order at the arcade so this purchase was a no brainer for me. However, there are some drawbacks. First of all there are too few games on here and the difference between each game is so minimal in some cases that its almost a crime (ie. Galaga and Galaxian). As a Galaga fan i was also disappointed by the timing on the laser fire. Its very slow and reminiscient of an early version of the game before the firing became more rapid. But in the end these gripes are rather shallow since for 20 dollars i was at least ensured a game console with a laser button that wouldnt get stuck in the fire position."
1402,3,Classic action,It's a great game but I suggest you rent it unless you grew up with these games. The action will wear off fast and the game will become obsolete within a month tops. That's about a dollar a day. Is it worth it?
1403,1,"If you are one of the 7 people who understand this book, please let me know","If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating."
1404,4,Oracular,"The best and truest use of Finnegans Wake is to practice the divination called ""bibliomancy"". In bibliomancy, you open a book to a randomly determined passage and peruse the selected text for insight into a question or problem so vexing that you've turned to divination for answers. Traditional books for this purpose are the Bible and Homer.The Bible and Homer are not ideal for this purpose the way Finnegans Wake is, though. With them, you're likely to light on something like a genealogy, a ship catalogue, or instructions for the curtains on the Tabernacle. But every page of Finnegans Wake is properly oracular, laden with obscure hints that might actually shed prophetic insight on the topic at hand. No other book is its equal for this purpose.And, of course, Finnegans Wake also has the advantage of being inerrant in all matters of fact clearly stated therein."
1405,1,"Whoa, dude!","My tenth grade English teacher made us read this book and I think it was way too hard! How is tenth grade students supposed to make any sense out of a mixed up book like this? I couldn't get any of it. What's the plot and whose the hero? I'm just really frustrated and I'm not alone. Only the class bookworm got past page 10 and I bet that weenie didn't understand much either, even if she says she did. Too hard, dude!"
1406,1,Contemptious,"The pretence here is to say that if you don't think its brilliant then the you must be a vacuous superficial fool. Its the same stunt as pulled by 'modern-art', whose lack of popularity and understanding among most people lends it a perverse exclusivity among irrational psuedo-intellectuals.No one 'understands' this book because there is nothing in it. Its not hard-going because it is so mentally challenging, its hard going because it is so uttlerly uninspiring. A dime pulp romance novel tells us more than this book can.If someone crafted your house with the same 'wondrous perception' as Joyce crafted this book, it would be rubble sunk in cement dust."
1407,5,In Defense,"this book is great for the very reasons it is hating. in response to the reviewer who noted that with a program he could write a sequel and that most Joyce scholars wouldn't tell the difference. Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us."
1408,5,Bunny Hugging,"I didn't expect to like this book at all. I certainly didn't expect to fall in love with it but that is exactly what happened! I love this book! It is really funny and readable, in fact it's a page turner! It really is a lot of fun and as I already said it is funny on almost every page. I think of it as a long beautiful poem written in a dream language. I like it better than any other Joyce."
1409,4,I wish I knew all the world languages to be able to read it!,"No, I haven't read it i have many times tried to but i simply can't. I have read and admired many other books by Joyce. However the words that I scarcely understand, sound to me like music. Riverum riverum..."
1410,2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."
1411,4,Question of thought,How would Nietzsche criticize Ramana Maharshi's philosophicaland ethical system of thought?
1412,4,Nietzsche is NOT the antichrist!,"Nietzsche is not fed up with christianity, he is fed up with christians, and the people who distort christianity. Nietzsche is not the antichrist, he is simply the Messenger in a greek tragedy. We are the antichrist.""In reality there has been ofnly one christian, and he died on the cross. The Evangel died on the cross. what was called 'Evangel' from that moment on was already the oposite of what he had lived""antichrist 39Five stars for Nietzsche, three for the lack of notes. Also, there are many times when Nietzsche writes in french or latin and there is no note or translation.ps I'm older than twelve."
1413,2,"defective, very disappointed","This tabletop pocket chart arrived with a defect and I had to return it to get my money back. The inside of each clear plastic pocket was covered with an extra layer of cheap, tear-able, thin plastic. Several places it was torn, creating a messy obstructed view for any pictures or words I would put in the plastic pockets. This made the product unusable."
1414,5,A MUST HAVE!,"I think every Christian should recieve a copy of this book directly after baptism! It has been so helpful in proving to me the value of the spiritual disciplines, as well as explaining each of them in great detail. It is practical and concise, and has really been a blessing, truly a must have."
1415,2,The Other Side Of A Christian Classic,"Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"
1416,5,Delightful,I am delighted to have read this book and will find delight in reading it again very soon. Recommended to all!
1417,2,Not sure about veracity of the material,"The author begins with the statement that she has probably spiced up the material a lot. Since, most of the author's story is around her sexual encounters, and she has stated that she has spiced up the material, it is not clear how much truth exist in this autobiography. Read it with a grain of salt. The book, however, does provide some interesting insight on the Saudi society."
1418,2,an awful card,"Good parts: installation was easy, im not a computer-type just an avg young person. Has many cool features, TV-out,dual moniter etc.Bad parts: my computer is 5 years old with a really crummy vid card, and i play a lot of online games with it. They usually run 20 or 30 frames per second, which is barable but i could do better. so i went to comp usa and the guy told me to get this one because it was plenty fast. I installed evrything properly but even after tweaking and adjusting to the max all i could get was 12 fps. This card was so useless i exchanged it for a PNY technologys Verto geforce 4 ti 4400 card, which rocks btw....rocks hard."
1419,3,Decent But Not Great,"I have had this for a week. This is a decent passive laptop cooler for my 15.4"" laptop which I used to not be able to use on my lap because of how hot it got. The bumpers provide enough lift to allow my laptop's fan to work properly. I was surprised I had to attach the 3 bumpers myself. I almost accidentally threw them away. But I guess it was a smart idea so I can put the bumpers where my laptop needs them.What I don't like is that what this 'lapinator' is made out of is real cheap. Looks like it could deform or bend really easily. Gets scratched up too. And the bottom pads aren't too comfortable. They do the job, but again, cheap. Way too pricy for what it actually is. The mousitizer works well for my mouse. Though if I leave the mouse alone I have to be careful and have my lap really level or the mouse will slide off.Overall, it does the job, but should not cost anywhere near $40."
1420,1,"Much, MUCH better available... I suggest you keep looking","I am not at all pleased with ""the Lapinator"" product. It is not rigid at all, the flimsy plastic top distorts from laptop heat, and it's not wide enough (and I have the larger one).[...] They are not terribly durable, lasting only about a year before suffering stress cracks, but they are great while they last!"
1421,4,Great,"I bought the lapinator and Mousitizer after a lot of searching (and a few failed home builds) so I could comfortably watch movies, play games etc on my bed in Iraq. I wasn't expecting much but when the Lapinator finally arrived it became a must have for several people in my living area. It was light weight and the non-skid feet would allow you to prop the computer up a little without worrying about it falling over. Even after a marathon session of gaming on an off day my legs we're hot from the laptop and the feet allow a good bit of air flow to go under the computer so even my computer was cooler than expected.! My only complaint is the mouse part is rather flimsy and putting a lot of pressure can cause it to fall off and just using it causes it to slant downward.4/5"
1422,1,I didn't know Sepultura was hardcore.,"It's interesting that Hatebreed gets so much for credit not following in the steps of Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, when they now tour with bands like that. Its also interesting in light of the fact that their music is basically identical to any alterna-metal band's, except without what little talent or melody those bands possess. This band has as much to do with hardcore as Sepultura. I thought this was a joke band when I heard it. f you're really interested in hardcore, put down that jug of Weight Gainer 900, turn off your victory sampler CD, and order a Universal Order of Armadgeddon CD immediately. And stop wearing so much adidas, newjack."
1423,3,"Martial is excellent, translation is sloppy","Firstly, let me say that I am not an expert in Latin, though I am certaintly able to read it, understand it, and also know a little about its literary techniques. One of the most grating errors I have found in this translation is the continual rhyming of its lines. Latin, being a language of often mutable word ending but even more amorphous word order, had no need to rhyme its verse, and therefore any translation, in English, that insists on rhyming for any purpose usually obfuscates the original meaning so much that it is, in of itself, a whole different poem.I have also seen the ommission of many names in the work, which I find unappealing. While I do enjoy that it is able to combine the original latin with the english translation, I would recommend searching for a similar book with a better translator: it will make the epigrams far more enjoyable."
1424,5,Decent dashboard cover for the money,"This cover did not fit perfect, but it is good enough for my old camper van. Helps with the glare from the old metal dash and looks nice too."
1425,1,"Worse than ""The Quest""","The beginning of the film is nothing more than a hurried attempt to get Van Damme to the Foreign Legion where the real story and action begins, right? Unfortunately, the rest of the film is nothing more that a snoozefest ripoff of other war movies. At least Van Damme didn't do the splits in this movie. Then again, that might have given the film a memorable momement."
1426,3,Not Bad as You May Think But...,"Here in Japan, this film was given a limited theatrical release. in 2001. Before I see this movie, I knew this film went straight to video in US,so I didn't expect much fun from it. Frankly, the plot is a dull one; the situation is borrowed from the typical ""leginnaire"" films like Beau Geste, and there is nothing new nor original here. Well, and for fans of the previous films of the star, it must be disappointing because there is no bone- crunching action scenes. Still, it has good, authentic location, and superb supporting cast including Steven Berkoff and Nicholas Farrell. My favorite actor, Steven Berkoff, displays his over-the-top acting (though a bit overacting, you may think), and I find it very delightful, and Nicholas Farrell's subtle performance is giving some reason for not avoiding the video. Not a classic, but good one of the genre."
1427,2,Boring Van Damme Movie,"Jean-Claude Van Damme needs to stay direct-to-tape after this slow, drawn out movie. He joins the French legion after he doesn't take a fall for a couple of gangsters. Ludicrous piece of film-making which never surfaces and grabs the audience's attention. Van Damme has never really made a good action movie and he needs to go down in history as one of the worst action stars to ever hit Hollywood."
1428,1,No,"These products are a great idea in theory, but in reality the dog isn't able to pant like it needs to and it is very uncomfortable for them. Not a good idea."
1429,4,Sizing is a little off,"I agree with the other reviewer about the sizing. 0 is supposed to be for a doxie size, but my Jack Russell/Pug (20lbs) mix can slip out of it when it's not set super tight. We have a min-pin mix, about 11lbs, and I worry if we order another 0 it will be too big. Honestly 0 should fit the smallest dog, not a 25 pounder! Still a good product despite the sizing issues and the cost is good compared to other's."
1430,4,"Helped, but..","This product is really nice and it seemed to help out my 15 lbs chorkie, but she quickly learned how to get it off by putting her paw on the part that attaches to the collar. I think it would be fine if her muzzle was a bit longer- her is maybe 1-2 inches long so it came off quite a bit. Otherwise, it really helped with pulling and while it was on her face it made walking enjoyable. :)"
1431,5,Flawless,"I have used the SimpleTech 128MB SmartMedia card with my Olympus D-520 camera. I have had no trouble with this card, and can store plenty of images (100 at the highest resolution, and about 750 at the lowest.) There is only one problem with this card: getting it out of it's package can give anyone a real headache."
1432,3,good movie - poor blu-ray quality,"The movie was good plus different, but the blu-ray quality was no better than an upconverted dvd at best sees ya!"
1433,3,Acceptable,"A fun addition to the Stargate mythos, but not much more than an elongated episode. I saw no reason for this to be a movie. It isn't a good buy for anyone except those collecting the entire series. Or fans of Ben Browder. He's dreamy!"
1434,2,Seriously Disappointing,"The original Stargate movie was pretty good, but I apparently missed at least one in between, because this one seemed to be assuming I knew things about the characters that I did not know. And to be honest, I couldn't seem to care. For one thing, it involved time paradoxes that provided apparently random kinks in the plot. So much ended up depending on whether character 1 recognized character 2, and vice versa. Again, dependent on at least one movie I missed, or on seriously poor writing."
1435,4,"Fun Alt-History storyline, great for the shelf... after watching a million times, of course","""Continuum"" is a to-be-expected episodic continuation of the SG-1 series. It doesn't fill in any gaps or danglers left from the series as did the DVD-only release for ""The Ark of Truth."" The quality and story is top-notch as always although it's more of a small-screen episode. The extra features certainly make it worth watching (Amanda Tapping and submarines... by way of e.g.), if not purchasing for a home library.The biggest thing about SG-1 is that it was such a compelling episodic piece that TV without it is bland... just as when the Star Trek serials were killed off by the bean counters, or BSG by it's regenerators... at least there's ""Stargate Atlantis"" for now... and the hopefully continuing DVD-only pieces like ""The Ark of Truth"" and ""Continuum."" If you like SciFi, ""Continuum"" is a collector or SG-1 fan's must-have."
1436,2,"Continuum, can't compare to Ark","Couldn't get into this. Ark of Truth was so much better, it served a purpose in the SG-1 time-line. Continuum, was just another episode of the show, rather contrived I might add. Seeing Claudia Black as Quetesh was one of the highlights. This movie really should have served to add more back story to the characters, revisit a storyline like (""2001"" or ""2010"") or advance the SG universe like finally having full disclosure. Basically I'm glad I waited to buy until it was half price."
1437,4,"Loved This one, but I hated the ""Ark Of Truth.""","Unlike Ark Of Truth this movie was very good, I loved the story line, the acting was great and seeing Jack again was the icing on the cake. If you know a bit about Stargate but never really watched most of the episodes you can still really enjoy this movie as it is a self contained story. Unfortunetly it still has Ben and Claudia in it but this time they somehow manage to not be so dominating and distracting.I would have given it 5 stars if they could have changed the timeline even more so that Ben and Claudia where still doing Farscape and the SGC was back to it's orginal cast."
1438,2,"A Decent Story, But Minimal Budget and Lack of Action Drag Down","I watched this movie hoping for closure to the franchise, and it delivered. But it still lacked that typical SG-1 zing to it that leaves a philosophical thought or critical sequence in your head for days. This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher. Hardcore SG-1 fans will enjoy this movie, but if you're not a long time fan or only watch the show occasionally, may as well give this one a miss. Due to a seemingly crammed together and rushed storyline."
1439,3,"Not bad, but a little rehashed.","It's not that Continuum is bad, it's just like you're watching a familiar, but much longer, episode that you've already seen.It's the SG-1 ""old reliable"" with time travel and parallel worlds. The exploration of Bahl's character is interesting, but doesn't really focus on the interesting questions. The movie sets up scenarios that aren't resolved to satisfaction. It's the usual, ""hey, let's create an alternate reality where we can kill off everyone or make a good guy into a bad guy, because it'll all get changed back at the end!""I have always enjoyed the SG-1 series. But, I had to watch this movie in two sittings, because it dragged so much. Stargate fans deserved a little better than this reheated left-over."
1440,3,Did I get a bad DVD of Stargate Continuum,"I loved the story and thoroughly enjoyed the story. The one problem I had was the sound mix. The volume of the music and special effects was 4 times that of the voice tracks. When the music came on I couldn't hear the actors. If I turned up the volume to hear the actors, the music was hurting my ears. I had to ride the volume control all through the movie and turn on closed caption to get what the actors were saying. I hope no one else has the same problem."
1441,4,StarGate: Continuum- Is this the End?,"I like the way this one turned out! Looks like they neatly and tidily wrapped up the G'ould saga and can now close out the series without loose ends, or have them move on to other enterprises like getting rid of those pesky Ori, once and for all!"
1442,4,Could have been better.,"I still enjoyed the movie, but it could have been much better. It felt like the plot was just starting to build up then the movie was suddenly over."
1443,5,Movie review: Stargate: Continuum,I really liked the movie. It cleared up a few of the story lines in the series.I would recommend the movie to any Stargate fan.
1444,4,Sanyo Rice Cooker,"Really like this rice cooker - keeps cooked rice warm nicely, easy to use - nothing negative to report."
1445,1,Difficult to clean,"I really liked this cooker until I tried to clean it. My old rice cooker had a separate lid and I never noticed this difference in my research. This one is fixed on. I wish I had read the review that said the same thing I am now saying and took note. It's impossible to clean around all the gaskets and time consuming to try. Major design flaw. Other than that, it does make great rice."
1446,3,An average rice cooker,"I purchased this rice cooker to replace my 30 year old (yes, 30) National unit. It cooks rice well enough, no better or worse than my older one but at least it has the warming feature that my older one did not have. It also works very well as a steamer. However, there are two problems with this unit that are somewhat annoying. First, there is no ""on/off"" switch, so if it is plugged in the warming function is on so you cannot just leave it sitting on the counter top, plugged in. The second issue is that in my case, water collects between the inner and outer walls of the unit (I am guessing that the ""dew collector"" on the back is overflowing) requiring that I invert the unit and shake the water out.Overall, it is not a bad unit, but in my opinion Sanyo cut a few corners in an effort to keep the price down and it results in a less than ideal appliance"
1447,2,Rice cooker,Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.
1448,4,Gotta respect his consistency and focus!,"Each listener will decide if they like this release and which among the 3 Musiq releases they like best. Of all the neo-soul artists out in the last 5+ years, I probably have listened to Bilal, D'Angelo and Musiq most. However, I am especially impressed with Musiq's ability to crank out records every 2 years of solid to excellent quality. Many of the other neo-soulers seem to be struggling with doing this (I'm sure for various reasons - writer block; record company problems; etc). He reminds me of the time when Marvin, Steve, Aretha and others got product out every 1-2 years. And, today it's even harder since an entire album must consist of strong cuts, unlike the 60's when you could do a strong single or two plus fillers for the rest of the album (of course not to say there weren't many great 60's albums). Lots of respect to Musiq!"
1449,5,Awesome if you have the skills to cut it.,I bought two of these. My husband measured and cut them with our table saw. They fit great and are really nice quality. Everyone asks where I got them.
1450,4,Good Addition,"I like the game generally. It's nice to have a relaxing playable game like this in your collection.that said Pac-Man is just like Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, is just like Galaxian. Pole Position 1 and 2 BOTH ""are bad"".P>The best one here is Dig Dug and its ""arranged"" version.But why the heck did they have to make the screen so small?Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC(...)"
1451,3,charm,Am only collecting these for the butterfly theme I am going for . Love the color though . yada yada
1452,2,ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ,"Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."
1453,5,original and creative,"This is one of the most original movies I have seen in quite some time. The idea of showing 3 different versions of what could have happened is very creative. Somewhat like ""Sliding Doors"" in that respect, it explores the notion that if something had happened just a little bit differently, everything following could have turned out a completely different way. The performances are very good, the filming style is great, the plot and all its twists are completely original, and the rapid-fire pacing ensures that you'll never get bored. Thoroughly entertaining and recommended!"
1454,4,Just a few notes about the DVD commentary...,"The commentary by the director and Franka Potente (Lola) is entertaining but not so informative about the movie itself. They recalled many shooting details, but neglect to really talk about the movie in depth. Oh, they speak in perfect English, so don't worry about reading subtitles!"
1455,5,one of my favorites,"This movie is unlike anything you've ever seen or will ever see again. Lola has 20 minutes to find 100,000 marks to save her boyfriend from the mob. The movie shows three different scenarios and how the smallest thing, such as tripping on the way down the stairs, can effect your entire life. Very cool. Its the only movie I've seen that I can say I notice something new each and every time I watch it. You will not be bored by this movie. Its one of the few movies I've ever seen that can combine action and suspense with an intelligent plot. A must see!!"
1456,4,The reason to watch foreing movies.,"If you have seen Black Mask and Run Lola Run, then you will know where they got the ideas for The Matrix; and both movies were made before The Matrix. I rented the DVD and I'm going to buy both the CD Soundtrack and the movie!"
1457,2,A waste of time & money,"I never watched the entire video,I became disenchanted watching this style of German movie making.The use of cartoons takes much away from the story. I don't think I have patience to watch it againso I will probably trash it."
1458,3,OK for a German Movie,"I am German, and this is the first German movie I have EVER seen in the theaters! It was also my last one, because it didn't live up to my expectations - even though critics reported it was the best German movie ever... Anyway, the best part of the moive are the first 2 minutes (the preface). The idea itself is quite exciting, but strictly speaking, the movie is just 30 minutes long, and is repeated over and over again with vario9us scenarios... it get's very boring after a couple of minutes. Only the theme keeps you interested. It is not an action film, it is no thriller, no horror, no satire, I don't know what it is, but I wouldn't go for this one."
1459,4,very interesting,I bought the film as i enjoy foreign films (hollywoods handling of films is quite typical so foreign films add the something extra)- we saw this film as a family (with 2 teens) - i loved it but the kids groaned at times when they had to see the same scene repeated 3 times with difference. It was memorable and loved the direction and raciness
1460,4,"Exciting, original and highly entertaining","I'd hesitate to call this a masterpiece but it's about as much fun as any movie I've seen in recent years. It's relentlessly thrilling to watch, fresh-looking, well-acted, and the soundtrack complements the adrenaline-charged action perfectly. Don't expect your life to change, just expect a great time."
1461,3,An 82 minute music video,"With all the critics out there praising this movie from beginning to end, I just couldn't help but be a little curious. So I purchased it, hoping that it would at least live up to half the hype. Well, for all it's worth, Lola doesn't lack anything in the style department as promised. The critics weren't kidding when they said it had stunning visuals, a pulse pounding soundtrack, and a pace only a cheetah could catch up with. Unfortunately, it just plays out like an extended MTV music video. The plot starts off interesting and easy enough, but the twist and turns all end in such a predictable and almost rushed way. Almost like the director gave up on the last half of the movie. Sure, I like the whole ""cause and effect"" feel, but it could've been polished more. To keep it simple, Run Lola Run is a roller coaster ride of a movie with adrenaline pumping speed . Just be forwarned, it's not for everybody."
1462,4,Good Artsy Film,"Run Lola Run (Lola Rennt auf Deutsch) is an artsy film that some people might not get when they first watch it. I know it didn't until I watched it a couple more times.It's a movie about what ifs and without giving the plot to the story, there are lots of repeating scenes of what would have happened if I had done this. It is an interesting film, and I would recommend watching it in the original German rather than the English dubbed version."
1463,3,independent for the sake of being independent,"Run Lola Run. The first time I watched this flick (which is a in my own personal DVD collection) I wasn't blown away. There's allot of hype about the flick, how great the movie is, how mind blowing the music is, blah blah blah... and with the advice Flavor Flave gave us all about ""the hype"", I didn't believe it. Instead, I went out and bought it because I was curious. The plot? Girl runs to save boyfriend. That's it. It was like ""Groundhog Day"" on ecstasy. I'll give it credit for being original. I'll give it credit for knotting up all the details. I'll give it credit for energy, as it had a lot... but in the end, I was rather bored with the ending. It kind of fell off. The music, house music, which you can find in most new age independent films. Watch it in German with the subtitles, because the English dub is so over-acted, it makes it look ridiculous. You'll enjoy it more in German, as I did... the second time."
1464,2,A bit overrated. . .,"Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the ""alternate-scenario"" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point. Is there a point? Somebody please enlighten me."
1465,5,European Film At It's Best,"Run Lola Run is an intense suspense film. When Lola's boyfriend looses 100,000 DM from a drug drop and has to have it by noon he calls up Lola in desprate need of help. After suggesting to rob a grocery store, Lola pleeds with him not to and the movie kicks into three senarios of what may happen. Every time Lola gets the money, but it's a question of if she gets it there too late or if her or her boyfriend might even die first. The soundtrack is also amazing adding for an even larger on-the-edge-of-your-seat sensation."
1466,3,Good Online Store,Good Items Just Needs Some Work On The Details/Description Overall I Recommend Using The Site/App For Your Next Purchase You Might Save Time And Money
1467,3,"Reliable, yet slower than Sony Memory stick","Hi, this memory stick gave me no problems so far, but if I had to get picky, there is a noticable delay when writing the pictures to the memory stick. I used this stick on a Sony DSC P8. After taking a picture, the LCD screen would turn black for about 3-4 seconds, and it is probably writing to the memory stick during that time. I did not have this problem with the included Sony memory stick or the 256 Sony brand memory stick I bought. Reliable, but if you find this delay annoying, buy Sony."
1468,2,Two star because....,"I haven't used it yet!!! The plastic packaging is ridiculous, wasteful and HAZARDOUS as I just managed to cut myself trying to open it. Seriously, what a waste of resources. I can't imagine the energy and waste used just for the packaging. Why go through the effort of marketing and sitting around a conference room discussing how cool it would be to package a MEMORY STICK with razor sharp plastic with a neat colorful cardboard backround just so it can be thrown away to forever stay on the face of this earth to injure another person!!!? ah!! For a MEMORY STICK? Gimme a break!!"
1469,5,Excellent soup to nuts investing book,"This book covers all the bases and provided lots of great insights and ideas. I actually read Eric Tyson's Mutual Fund for Dummies first which I also thought was excellent.Covers traditional investments as well as real estate and small business. Coverage of online resources and software also was strong. Highly, highly recommended"
1470,1,Science lover,"This book is more like a joke, a classic example of cut and paste authors writing for a highly specialized topic with no technical weight. It never should be used for computer science students (unless the instructor himself has no clue about the subject). This book is for people with no formal training who want to learn some random buzzwords."
1471,1,Direct fit my a$$,"After consulting the Walker website I purchased this direct fit product for my 03 Impala.This muffler is only 15"" long and does not compensate in any way for the factory 16"" muffler.I ended up with a total redneck rig installation. WTFFollow up: I talked to Walker customer service, who were very nice, and was able to get a proper installation. Apparently the product is only ""direct fit"" if it bolts onto another aftermarket Walker product (Requiring me to buy more parts than I anticipated). To me ""direct fit"" means that it should attach to the OEM parts. Other than that the quality was fine."
1472,5,This book is one of the best that i have read in my LIFE!,"This is a fabulous book! It captures the reader, whoever that lucky person is, so that it is nearly immpossible to put it down. With a great plot, and many exciting moments, i would give this book 6 stars if the ratings even went that high. Also, the books Pale Phinix & Dreadfull Sorry are great, along with all of her other books."
1473,4,Good color reference matieral for model builders!,"Nice album of color images put together by a well known rail photographer.I met the photographer once at a ""Fall Festival"" at the railroad. Those were wonderful times when the railroad had four locomotives in steam at the same time. Anyway Mallory Hope Farrell was nice enough to sign my copy. I purchased it at the railroad on a prior trip. Mr Kovalchick,(the owner of the railroad) also signed my copy. So the book has added meaning to me now!If you are a model builder you won't be sorry you made this purchase!Some of the images were made in the 1950's before the Railroad shut down and was reborn as a Tourist Railroad/Museum. Very interesting to see what the ""Eastie"" looked like in the ""Common-Carrier"" days."
1474,3,"Alright, but not the best.","Not bad, but not the best french language album from Celine. If you're an english speaking fan, you should skip this album and just buy the On Ne Change Pas which features hits from this album. The vocals on this album and in general her french albums are just as or sometimes more melodic than her english albums but the vocal strength of the performances are not as dynamic or powerful...but still good enough to buy the french albums for cheap."
1475,1,Misleading Advertising,"Hand decorated? Maybe by slave labor in some 3rd world country. I should have read all the reviews more carefully. The only ""exotic"" thing about this purchase is probably the chemicals used in gluing the cheap paper onto the chest. There are glue splatters all over the top, and scratches on the inside. The paint on the corners looks like it was done by 3rd graders. I purchased this primarily for the chest, and could easily forgive the poor selection in flavors if the chest was worth more than $10. As it stands, I'm going to try to return this to Amazon ASAP.***Very Disappointed*** Read all the reviews before purchasing this!!"
1476,5,Gotta love gossip girl!,Gossip Girl had another good season! Can't wait for the 4th season! If you like season 1 & 2 u will like this one too!! The finale was awesome..
1477,1,Never received my item,"I waited weeks and weeks to get my order. They took my money and I still have received my item, money back, or feedback after emailing them nearly two weeks ago. I'm not ordering from them again."
1478,2,Really Not Worth It,"There is undoubtedly useful information in The Hidden Ivies. Most of it, however, is contained on the front cover. Other than naming the thirty colleges, ""Of excellence,"" the book does little to differentiate between the schools. In fact, the descriptions of six schools that I am considering (all contained in Greene's book) sound practically identical! Overall, this guide is useful for listing thirty colleges named on its cover. If you're looking for more information than that, look somewhere else."
1479,3,"Old Technology, but good for old PCs","I got this as a replacement to use in a very old, custom PC, which uses an AGP graphics card and runs on an Athlon CPU. I like the All-In-Wonder cards because they have A/V-in and A/V-out connections built-in. This is very handy for transferring old VHS tapes to your PC or to a DVD. The card also has a TV tuner built in, butit is analog-only and no longer usable."
1480,1,Terrible single,"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
1481,2,Conventional Wisdom for Morons,"This book is simply a compilation of repackaged material that anyone with common sense could write down on a piece of paper. The anecdotes are hokey and the BOLD ALL CAPS punch lines are simply there to take up space. Save yourself some money by sitting down and taking the time to think of how to package yourself in your job search. Also, Mr. Lucht makes sure that his self promotion is woven throughout the book. The kicker is that the book is simplisticly and exasperatingly written in a kind of folksy style. My advice: find someone that you or one of your friends knows who has changed careers, take them out to lunch and pick their brain."
1482,5,Excellent drive,"... This drive SUPPORTS Mt. Rainier (UDF 1.02), Mt. Rainier is the next generation UDF packet writing technology and it is better than UDF 1.50 which most of us are using right now (if you use packet writing at all). Mt. Rainier UDF technology handles error correction at the firmware level by the drive instead of by the burning software such as InCD, DirectCD, DLA, InstantWrite. The initial format is only 2 mins instead of 45 mins in UDF 1.50.This drive is very quiet and this is a very rare for drives that run faster than 32x."
1483,5,Excellent Classical Music,"This is definitely one of my favorite classical CDs of all times. The orchestral organization is superb. All the instruments come alive with each piece and you get to hear a lot of drums. Anyone who is new to classical music would love this CD by Bedrich Smetana who I think is really underrated in the world of classical music. I think his music is better than Mozart's by far. Buy it, you will not be disappointed!"
1484,4,nakita's review,"i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it."
1485,1,TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT,"I am sad to say after being so excited to get my kids this game it is horrible. Don't waste your time. Save your money and wait for a better, or get a different game. IGN.com gave this game a 1.1 out of 10 also. Which I read after playing it. Sadly this game is only frustrating and no fun. Save your MONEY!"
1486,2,Pointless,"Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included."
1487,3,Not as professional as I expected,"Finally a comprehensive book about the great Motoen artists from the ""Golden Age."" The A-Z format made it very easy to read, but the technical structure of the book seemed unprofessional and very computer generated. Sometimes graphics covered text completely. The photographs aren't exactly ""unseen"" as they are various. I expected less euphemisms and an accurate story. Some of it was very good, like info on David and Jimmy Ruffin's relationship with the Tempts and Motown, although you have to look around for it."
1488,4,An Oldie but a Goodie,"This material has been out a long time -- since the 70's but it's still as relevant and as helpful as ever. In this workbook Dunnam lays out a theology of prayer, teaches several different prayer practices and lays out the groundwork for an ongoing small group. That's pretty good for a ten week course!"
1489,5,The New A-Teens Single is out now!,"This cd is a great purchase for any A-Teens fan (and just for anyone else...) ! It has great remixes that are somewhat similar to the previous ""Halfway Around The World"" ones. In the other version of Sugar Rush there is another song. It's called ""Give It Up"". In almost all of the new singles they have included new songs. This is a must buy if you like the group's music.Ateens are sooooo cooooool and their new music is also great. Another great buy is Teen Spirit, which includes all of their Non-Abba-cover new songs."
1490,1,Not scary at all!,"The original was scary, but this is just an excuse to use special effects. This isn't scary, or funny, and should be on MST3K. Yes this movie is that bad. All the bad things you've heard about this movie, are truly an understatement to how bad it REALLY IS! This is ..., and will always be .... Sorry hollywood, but don't try again. We are a little harder to scare now. This would scare a 3 year MAYBE... but even that is giving it to much credit. Skip this and see something else."
1491,3,"GREAT EFFECTS, NOTHING ELSE.","This effects-heavy movie sure lays it on visually and sonically -- at the expense of a storyline or such horror essentials as suspense, pacing, etc. Even in the included making-of documentary, they mention that in horror it's not necessarily what you see, but what you don't see ... unfortunately they don't take their own advice.There are a few genuinely scary moments, but the momentum is lost, and the viewer is left with the impression of having seen some cool CG effects, but there's no effective build-up to a climax. After a while, the effects overpower everything else.DVD sound and picture quality are great. I'd recommend renting this one, since I can't see why I'd want to watch it again."
1492,1,Writer and director witoout souls,I cannot imagine a writer and director so soulless that they could read The Haunting of Hill House and come up with this drek. De Bont should go back to directing thrillers like Speed and Self should stick to comic books.
1493,5,the Haunting,An awesome movie! It keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat...Scary but realistic and ending was well worth watching the whole movie.
1494,3,Not So Bad,"I didn't know what to expect with this DVD. I'd heard some bad reviews of this. However, it wasn't the totally awful movie some say. It is not your basic, horror (ie slasher) movie, it works more with suspense, and the plot unrolling to give you the whole store. (I admit, I haven't seen the original, but then again, I'm judging this only on it's own merit) While not the WOW WHAt a Great MOVIE experience I've had with some, it was entertaining for the afternoon. The effects were good, and there was the element of suspense in many scenes, instead of blood and guts. Buy it , rent it, love it hate, - As long as your not expecting the greatest horror movie ever, and just an afternoon of entertainment, you're fine. and no, it's Not Blair Witch (Oh THANK GOD it's not, now that was overhyped and a huge let down! )"
1495,3,You've gotta appreciate the sets!,"It doesn't seem like many people enjoyed this flick, but it really wasn't that bad. The plot was a little lame, but the acting wasn't bad. If you are into castles and architecture, this is a ""must see."" The sets are phenomenal! The FX pretty awesome too. The best acting was from the two ladies, Lili Taylor and Catherine Zeta Jones, everyone else plodded through. Watch it for the huge, gothic, breathtaking sets - you can't pull your eyes away. Fabulous."
1496,5,"Scary,funny,with C.Zeta Jones and an extremely ugly ghost!!!","Finaly a good remake,its not as good as the original but still a must see with some breathtalking special-effects! Lilly Taylor in one of her best roles yet and a well acting Catherine make this picture an unbelievable one! It doesn fright you as much as the ""old Haunting"" because you see ""animated"" ghosts in the remake! In the original you dont see ghosts at all and thats much scarier! Its an intertaining movie which I saw about 12 times and I never get enough of it! A must see for every fan of the ghosthouse-stories! With some good Special Features!!! And an ugly, frog-looking-like ghost called ""Hugh Craine"""
1497,1,The Haunting is just... bad.,"If you want a good haunted house flick, get something else... anything else. This film has a pretty set, but no character development, no suspense, no scares, and no point."
1498,1,Two hours I'll never get back!,"When I heard they were remaking ""The Haunting,"" I was excited. I love the original movie. I thought that with the modern techniques we have, we could make a good movie better.I was wrong. Sitting through this stinker was torture. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that's similar to Shirley Jackson's novel and the original movie is the name. Want to do something fun? Go get a root canal. It would be a lot more fun than this movie."
1499,2,"Boring, not scary",This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it.
1500,4,I liked this movie,"I thought this movie was very good. Granted it is PG-13, but it had much more tense situations than that rating would bely. I loved the special effects. They were similar to 'The Mummy'. The fluid effects on the curtains and the face in the dust are astounding. I felt this movie did suffer from a lack-luster script but the effects increased its appeal. This was a good movie and is not one for your youngins. It is filled with scary moments."
1501,2,Huge talents in a poor poor movie,"Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie."
1502,2,About as scary as The Simpsons!,"I saw this movie at the cinema and thought it was ok, so I bought it on DVD and found out i could only enjoy it the first time i had seen it. It was boring and the only good bit is the Special Effects ending. I would only recommend this as a rental!"
1503,2,Try something else.,"I just didn't get anything out of watching this movie. It neither scared or even interested me. The special effects were good, but this movie just didn't work for me. Wasn't captivating or that involving. Liam Neeson is a great actor, but even he can't do much for The Haunting. There are better movies out there."
1504,1,This movie stinks!,"This movie proves that hollywood is trying to dismantle every great film from it's past.Like every movie made today it has tons of stupid special effects,no acting,and a lousyscript. I think of all the hard work Robert Wise did on the original film only to beflushed down the toliet by the no talent crap we have in hollywood today!"
1505,4,Not that bad after all,"Okay, the story isn't very logical all the time, and there's not much suspense either, but the amazing dolby 5.1 soundtrack blows you away ! Add to this the fantastic special effects and a few perfectly timed shock-moments -""The Haunting"" is filmed like a classic horror movie, but it uses state of the art technics to give it a modern look. Not my favorite movie of the year, but definately not the worst one either -give it a chance."
1506,1,"The only thing ""HAUNTING"" me is the money I wasted","a decent scare or two during the first 45 minutes, but I can that from my own driving."
1507,2,A very poorly done horror movie.,"A group of people who has sleeping problem are the subject of an experiment by a scientist (Liam Neeson). The experimen takes place in a haunted house. Doesn't make any sense to me. The story is bad, the screenplay is bad even all the performers here are bad. This is by far the worst movie by Jan de Bont. Frankly after the first ""Speed"", all his movies are going down hill and this one hits rock bottom. I am giving it 2 stars for outstanding audio and video quality of the DVD."
1508,2,Mediocre horror movie,"I guess the special effects were OK.... Frankly, however, this was kinda a big disappointment - with fine actors like Neeson and Zeta-Jones you'd expect more. Rather give this one a skip and go watch the 'Scream' movies all over again....."
1509,2,okay movie with a couple scary parts,"You might like it and you might not.i havent seen the 1960's version and i bet it's a whole lot better than this.it depends if your a ghost story fan.if you are,see this."
1510,1,AWFUL!,"I was so furious by this piece of trash that I could barely speak. They hijacked Shirley Jackson's novel and made a mess. The film misses all of the fine characterizations of the novel and just crumples them into cardboard caricatures that you could care less about. The building suspense and the sense of dread are jettisoned for over the top CGI effects and cheap scares. This movie was just an excuse to show off computer generated effects.Too much 90's psychobabble finds itself in and reduces the end to an Opera episode: Ghostly old patriarchs who abuse kids and the women who confront them. Get the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"" and read The haunting Of Hill House by Shirley Jackson and discover what true horror is."
1511,5,Great movie,This movie is one of my favorites. It's like a more modern version of Hell House. It's graphics are great just like movies made today. Suspenseful.
1512,5,THE BEST FILM EVER.,"The Movie was awsome, I liked the Effects,the Loud sounds and the Location of the Movie which was filmed in the Harlaxton Manor in England. the story was good and the environment of the film was the best. a must see. dont't axpect to see super hero's or people with guns and action or the Matrix, cause its just a haunted house story of supernatural. Kind of like Stephen Kings-(the Shining). the next movie ive gotta see, is (The Haunting on Hill House)."
1513,1,"Not frightening, not anything","There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student."
1514,3,"Loved Owen Wilson, But That's All","When my dad said this movie was one of the boring films he had ever seen, I agreed with him. In fact, the only thing that kept me from leaving was taking one look at Owen Wilson and nearly falling off my chair. ( The man is gorgeous. And for all of you who don't agree with me, you can go and have your head eaten by a lion-headed flue:op) Then, I ended up watching it again with seven teenage girls who all wanted to own the house. ( The only way you could get me to stay there was if you gave me $1,000,000 and Owen to do with as I please >:P) In short, I gave the three stars for Owen being there, otherwise, the plot is lame and there are too many effects. Also, Liam Neeson had me wishing he would die.If you want me to recommend a good movie, go see "" Shanghai Noon"", a great film, with a cute story, and the even cuter Owen Wilson. I'm not going to say this film was awful, but it was pretty boring. That's all folks!"
1515,5,A Haunting Thriller,"The ""Haunting"" (1999) was a thrilling masterpiece. It combined editing pace, lighting, incredible sound & cinematography to create a thrilling suspense film. The viewer can not help being drawn into the story of Nell, played by Taylor. While the script is weak in places, the directors make up for it with computer-generated effects and incredible sound effects that leave the viewer wondering what's around the next corner. The setting (the castle) provides an excellent adventure for all. As a kid, I used to wander through abandoned houses at night and get spooked. This brings the fantasy of wandering through an old castle to life. In my opinion, this is a MUST HAVE for any video/DVD library."
1516,2,"Oh no,","It is in movies like these that I really miss poltergeist, the fog, and the good old scarefests that really knew how to scare.This movie is good, in the beginning, when it all isn't so complex.But then, after that, the story really gets really complex, and instead, about evil being just evil, it is really about some old fartknocker who is some marble short. In the end of the movie, it is just a concept that has swallowed a little bit of its own lunch, and some bad acting as well.No. The effects are so so. But it doesn't matter much if you don't believe in the movie. Trust me, don't watch this one, its an experience which won't be the worst film you'll ever see. But hardly the best either."
1517,3,THE MOVIE THAT INSPIRED SCARY MOVIE 2,"THIS MOVIE DIDN'T SCARE ME HOWEVER , IT WAS STILL A GOOD STORIE .THE GOOD :1# THE STORIE2# IT SET3# THE PLOT4# LIAM NEESON & CATHERINE ZETA JONESTHE BAD :1# OWEN WILSON & LILI TAYLOR2# LILI SEEMED LIKE A WHINNY LITTLE B!TC# WHO DURING THE LAST BATTLE WITH CRANE , JUST SEEMED UNDER DRAMATIC AS SHE WAS BASICLY JUST TALKING DOWN TO IT LIKE CRANE WAS A CHILD !3# IT NEEDED MORE SCARY MOMENTS FOR IT TO BE A HORROR FILM .THE HIGH LIGHT FOR ME WAS WHEN WILSON WAS DECAPITATED ... HE'S NOT A BAD ACTOR , JUST A WRONG CHOICE FOR THIS FILM . HIS HUMOR WAS ALL WRONG FOR THIS MOVIE ."
1518,2,in the crappy tradition of houseonhauntedhill and 13 ghosts,"there are some pretty crappy haunted house movies out there like 1999's House On Haunted Hill and 2001's 13 Ghosts, people who find those scary and intelligent should be shot because their a heap of junk. this one is alittle bit above both but the story and characters drop it in some parts. Lili Taylor at the end is horrible but Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson add some spark and some comedy to it especially Wilson and Catherine Zeta Jones is ok as well as the bisexual. strictly a horrible remake done by DeBont after the classic original"
1519,4,Pretty scary-not so swift ending,"I think that The Haunting is a good scary movie(as opposed to movies like ""Scream""). Instead of dealing with pyscho people running around in masks, it actually deals with the supernatural which is always fascinating. The movie was cast very well and the special effects are incredible. The ending however, twisted the movie into a theme of bliss, contentment, and nurturing. A good scary movie should leave you with a sense of ""what will happen next?"". On the other hand, it would be hard to have a nightmare about it! All in all, it is a good movie that really screams the theme ""good vs evil""."
1520,1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL","To say that this version of ""The Haunting"" lacks all of the understatment, subtlty, and nuance of the book is obvious. To say that it lacks logic, coherence, character, and good directing is even more obvious. Unfortunately, the film is not aimed at the intellectual crowd who are fans of Jackson's book, or the classic horror fans of the original movie. Instead, the filmmakers (one of whom is, in this case, the gloriously misguided Steven Spielberg) have aimed the story at the video game/music video crowd, sacrificing every nuance and plot element to the whirlwind of uninteresting and unmotivated special effects. In a house where anything can happen, nothing is frightening when it finally does."
1521,1,"ABSOLUTELY DISMAL, DISTRESSING FILM","Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"
1522,5,A Scholarly Book for Serious Students of Yiddish,"Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."
1523,2,Not great - doesn't cover SQLite 3.0,"This is an old book, and doesn't cover the newer SQLite 3.x information."
1524,2,sound quality ??????,the songs are good tunes but the sound quality is not very good. on some tunes you can hardly hear the guitar that is muffled by the bass.in fact the entire cd sounds muffled. i would go with raunch & roll before this one
1525,4,"Looks good, but not for mobile applications.","I was hoping this unit would work out as a transmitter/receiver in my race car. It is small, rugged, and runs on 12 volts. I contacted RF Link and they even sent me a unit to try out, along with their amplifier, so that definitely says good things about them. Unfortunately, it did not work at all for me. As soon as the car started moving the signal started coming and going and video quality, well, it looked great before the car started moving.Still, looks like a good system, just not if you plan to be moving it around."
1526,1,Not as advertised,The listing states that it works at 1000' take away a 0 and it might work at 100'. Don't waste your money if you are hoping on going from room to room. if you need it in the same room that would be fine.
1527,2,Asvab for Dummies,It was a good book but the pages was yellow and the book was old. It should of said ok book instead of good book. But I love the book and it breaks down the questions.
1528,4,good book,I have not gotten through the book but so far so good. Its very informative. i cant complain about it.
1529,4,Good,"Good test taking strategies. I was able to identify the areas I need to practice/focus more one. I took all the practice tests feel pretty confident taking the ASVAB. Good review over the areas of subject to study, however may need to do a little bit more research in some areas ie Science, Vocabulary."
1530,2,LOTS OF ERRORS!!!,This book was a good refresher... but BEWARE! The math sections are FULL of errors! FULL OF ERRORS!!!
1531,3,Beginner Yogi ~ Over my Head,I aspire to get to the level depicted in this video. I'm a beginner yogi and eventually will grow into this video. Thanks.
1532,2,Say what??!!,"Well, I don't understand what everyone saw in this that I missed, but clearly, I missed it. This is definitely NOT a workout for beginners. It is far too difficult, too long, too advanced, too fast, with far too little instruction. There are many better yoga DVDs out there. Yes, I surf. Yes, I have a regular practice. May I suggest Rodney Yee's ""Yoga For Athletes""? Not specifically for surfers as this one claims to be, but superior in production, and he leads you through the routine...and you may actually use it."
1533,5,"Get the feel of Rome, not a tour guide.","As usual, before a trip to other country, I searched for a book that would give me a feel for the cities I visit, rather than a tour guide. This book excelled in this task and made my visit to Rome even fuller and more enjoyable. If you are looking for a book about Rome, its people, their habbits and a little glimpse into their rich history, this book is a rare find. The pace is calm, the subjects are simple, but the experience is great."
1534,3,Freaks Freaks Freaks,"""The Sinful Dwarf"" is a Danish/American production which actually played in theaters in Denmark (I've talked people to who saw the ""shocking"" premiere). The lead actor, Torben Bille, is one the most recognized dwarf actors in Denmark...I guess, he would rather forget this ultra bizarre piece of sexploitation.Torben lures innocent young girls to his mom's house with help of mechanical toy poodles. They are drugged and tied up and later abused by ""clients"" and/or sold into slavery. In between, Dwarf and his drunk mom are doin' several musical numbers. The many sex scenes are pretty close to porn and the soundtrack reminded me of the Residents. It's like an insane mix between ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" and ""Pink Flamingos"" with zero comic relief - this movie will blow your mind. Trash film mogul Harry Novak also backed ""Please Don't Eat My Mother"", ""Kiss Me Quick"" etc."
1535,3,beware!!! at least one supplier sells vinyl.,"can't speak to the audio. the product description says CD single. the cart description adds LP record. before purchase, I attempted to contact supplier to no avail"
1536,5,Clear and detailed Explanation makes it a good book,"I have not really read the famous books by Steven Kay or other popular books in this topic. So I do not claim to be the authority to compare this book with other ones.But i felt this book has fantastic explanation on the topic it claims to cover ( Detection and Estimation theory - D&E; ). Detection theory starts only in the fifth chapter and the first four chapters clearly build the fundamentals in probability and linear algebra among others that are relevant for D&E.; As the author introduces you the necessary concepts, he clearly tells you in what context those will be used in the topics that follow later. In my opinion the motivation to introduce a concept is very essential.D&E; concepts are explained very well too and has quite a lot of examples that explained well and they feature at the right time and right place"
1537,4,Plenty of room for a reasonable price,I tried this compact flash with my Canon S40 camera and found that it was provided plenty of room for pictures. This card performed faster than the CF card provided by the camera. I'm very satisfied with it. I get about 220 shots on a 4 Meg medium resolution format. There is minimum lag time between pictures. I did find that having a CF card reader is a lot faster and loading and unloading pictures from the card.
1538,2,Started out good..,"I read this book before it became an Oprah pick- and was almost appalled that she had chosen it as something she deemed worthy for others to spend their precious time reading! It started out good to me, I didn't mind the magic realism. I actually thought it was quite charming. But after awhile it seemed that the story just went on, and on, and on... with no real end in sight. Most of the book just seemed kind of like page fillers to me,with no real significance to the story. I was ready to put the book down before I got even half way through, but forced myself to trudge through it to the bitter end. As far as recommendations go, I would recommend passing on this book- or at least borrowing it from a devoted Oprah book club reader. Don't spend your money on it."
1539,5,"A sweeping, epic novel that touches the heart to its core!","The strength of One Hudred Years comes from its ability to effect your entire being. The simple, layered prose involves the reader in a fantastic journey through the life and times of a town and family. The story speaks to you, just as stories did when you were a child, bringing an incredible reality that is both graspable and surreal."
1540,5,My all time favorite,I absolutely love this book and have read it more than once. The magic realism is great!! It reads like a fairy tale and makes the unbelievable become almost believable to the reader. The book follows a family through the generations. History constantly repeats itself and each generation is affected by the choices the previous generation has made.
1541,3,Great Writing but a purely cerebral pleasure,"After reading half way into the book, I started to enjoy the author's methodology of writing. I have never read a book with such an unique and amazing way of linking things together from different space and time and putting it in a linear fashion. Unfortunately I cannot appretiate the story anymore than the average person can appretiate modern art. It is something only a few select intellectual connoisseur can appretiate. But one thing is how many of the people would actually give it 5 stars if they never knew anything about the Noble Prize or the Oprah book club etc?"
1542,3,"Great writing, difficult to follow","I agree with others that this is a difficult read. I was honestly enjoying the book after the first couple of chapters, however. The writing is excellent, the story and its many twists intriguing. It all fell apart for me about halfway through when I realized I was no longer able to distinguish the characters and keep up with who was child of whom and who had died and how, etc. -- all critical to the continuing understanding of the story line. The author's choice to give the vast cast of characters very similar names was mind boggling. After a point, I simply could not -- without a fair amount of note-taking and diagramming I was not willing to do --keep up with all of the Aurelianos and Arcadios. Hats off to those who could finish it. I, unfortunately, could not."
1543,1,A skilled rapist,"The acrid smell of sweat, dung and animals, coupled with the stifling heat, permeates the village of Macondo, where the novel takes place. Incest, murder, and suicide are everyday happenings, especially the first. Marquez pushes a dizzying and horrifying picture of the human condition, which left me feeling as if I had been raped. My options here seem to be either to dismiss Marquez as an extraordinarily skilful madman or to go mad myself. I choose the former. An ugly novel, not the less ugly for the undeniable talent with which it is executed. I do not recommend it."
1544,2,"All tell, no show","I read literary fiction, ""smart"" books, and could deconstruct an eggplant if I needed to. And this book is a chore to read.It is all tell and no show. One long narrative.But that is not what I consider to be the source of the problem. Here's what is: the book is not compelling.Many people assume a book that has won prestigious awards must be great, but awards can spread like a virus, wiping out independent judgement along the way.I just finished reading Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy. It is smart and beautiful and compelling and much more worthy of your reading time."
1545,1,one hundred years of futility,"This book is pernicious. LIfe is predetermined, plotless, circular and meaningless. Why bother to write a book at all, if in the end, this is the grand message. How sadistic."
1546,5,More real than history,"These 100 years in Macondo are some how more magically real than real history, and as mythical as the Bible. With 5 Arcadio's, and 22 Aurelianos, there is so much ""family history"" that the names become confusing ... but this helps create the feeling of dynasty, of repetition, and the inseparability of past, present and future. ... ""The first of line is tied to a tree and the last is being eaten by ants"". Colonel Aureliano Buendias endless melting and creating his gold fishes also highlights this cycle and the interplay of memory and forgetting.Full of sensuous smells as Melquiades' laboratory, tastes as Rebecca's mud, and delightful colors as Mauricio's yellow butterflies the book can be intoxicating. The interplay of reality, fantasy, and magic made for a remarkable read!"
1547,3,"An impressive novel, but I just never got 'hooked'!","Well, this one took me nearly six months to finish! I kept putting it down to read other more 'gripping' books. While I appreciate this novel for its wonderful writing and memorable characters and I am impressed by the book itself, I just found that I was never really 'hooked' by the story. Perhaps it lost something in translation (although I don't think I'll be attempting to read it in Spanish anytime soon!), or maybe I just had trouble with the non-chronological ordering of events (I like my stories to be linear!). Overall, an impressive novel, and one that I appreciate for its originality and scope, but did not thoroughly enjoy."
1548,3,interesting wordsmith,"starts interesting but stream of consciousness gets oldand range of players is limited.yes unique literature but not that satisfying.ANd thats what I felt.If I dont skim a book so I do drink in all its flavors, then that is a good novel.Do we write jsut for the literati? or anyman?TO whom are we trying to convey some of life?Do I need to repeat the same atmospehre over and over?Should I marvel in how they show stupidity or comic relief?"
1549,5,Read one copy so many times it fell a part!,"This is a novel that takes you away from the world of today and the horrible problems you are saturated by on TV, newspapers, radios, etc. .... makes you know that a hard life is not without trials and problems but the horror seems less intense and families continue no matter what."
1550,5,Oprahs may be the devil...,"But dont let that stop you from reading this book. This is the a must read for everyone. As I finished the last page of this book, I flipped it over and started it again. Mr. Marquez takes literature to a new level. This book is seriously clowning on a lot of other recommended and required books throughout history. To not read this book, is to not ever truly experience a great story. Whatever sad excuse for a book you are reading put it down and pick this up. You will never forgive yourself if you dont."
1551,3,One Hundred Hours of Humid Reading,"This was not an easy read by any means. I forced myself to finish it. The writing is good to excellent, but the multi-generational Aurelianos are so convoluted and confusing. Luckily, Marquez reminds you of the characters', background so you aren't totally lost following all the threads. The imagery in many places is sublime, fascinating, dark, mystical, crazy. It almost reminds me of watching a Tim Burton movie ( I had just seen Big Fish) with much more detail and story weaving. Sometimes you don't know when reality starts and stops, but that is also the beauty of this story. So many characters were living in their minds and not in the present. The matriarchal strength in this story binds it all. You have to pay attention and not read this before going to bed. At the end, I had to brush off the cobwebs and scrape off the moss from myself. I was lucky the ants remained outside."
1552,5,"lost in space, ideas, lost in our solitude","All I can think when I read this book is the human comedy(tragedy) that we are trying to play. The comedy of life, of our solitude that has its roots deeply inside our souls. This book is a mirror of the human soul and of our society. The image reflected is tragic, is the image of souls that fight to survive in this mix of love, hate, ignorance, geniality and pain that is commonly known as LIFE. Marquez is great and this book is the reason why Marquez is great. READ IT."
1553,2,Tedious,"I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."
1554,1,I just don't get it...,"After reading the reviews for this book, I was excited to read it. I am a huge fan of magical realism, but this novel...I just don't get it. I have about 100 pages left, and this may be one of the first books I do not finish reading. It just seems to go on and on and on...with nothing exciting or engaging. I feel like I am missing something about this book after reading the overwhelming majority of GREAT and moving reviews, but it just isn't my cup of tea."
1555,1,Would've taken me 100 years to read,"I read a ton of books, and have no problem with long or ""difficult"" reads. But it was just plain excrutiating to read this book! I got about halfway through and, after speaking with others who finished it and was told nothing really ever happens, I gave up. It's the same boring stuff over and over again. The characters' names are all so similar it's impossible to keep track of who's who, but who cares, because the author doesn't give you reason to care about any of them anyway! It's business as usual for a long time with regards to realism, then out of nowhere.. a flying carpet. (I'm sure at that point in the book, I resembled my dog tilting his head to one side over something perplexing and unexplainable.) There are sooo many captivating and enriching books out there.. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one."
1556,1,ARRRRRRRGH,"I forced myself through this because someone told me it would be good. Every day I read this I expected to be blown away. Alas, I was disappointed. After several hundred pages of unoriginal dribble and disgusting incest, I finally came up for air. About every three lines in this book I felt like having an aneurism. The ""magical realism"" crap that everyone rants lovingly about in this book is a load of garbage. No, it's not creative. It's boring and annoying. The author randomly throws supernatural phenomena into the story at random points and doesn't have enough originality or creativity to explain it or make it interesting; he just moves on. No, sorry, I won't explain why this person is psychic. Oops, this person just snapped. Sorry. Hey, whaddya know! It's raining flowers. Oh why not I'll throw in some ghosts... maybe some magical gypsies... and we've got an inane bore-fest. Useless."
1557,2,"I can see its appeal to some, but I didn't like it....","I picked up this book to read it because several of my friends were reading in from the Oprah book club. It is a complex novel with many characters and a very mystical feel to it. The writing has a stream-of-consciousness style to it which makes you feel like you are listening to someone tell you a story with lots of side remarks. My issue with this novel was not the mystical feel or the writing style, though they do take some getting used to. My problem was that the whole thing just seemed to be about war and sex, and although both things have their place in life and literature, they weren't things that I wanted to read an enormous novel about. Also, this book is really quite tragic and I just prefer to read things with a more positive spin. I can see how this novel would appeal to some people because it is so complex and meaty....there is a lot to the stories in this book! It just wasn't for me."
1558,3,The end justified the read...,"I was recommended this book years ago by a close friend, who considered it the best book she had ever read in her life. When I finally broke down and bought a copy, it took me forever to finish this. I believe that this was due in part to Marquez's annoying and often-confusing habit of giving every male in this three-generational family a derivative of the same name. (The family tree at the beginning of the novel became a favorite resting nook for my baby finger.)But while lengthy, this novel was never boring, as the author's prose were always poetic, lyrical and interesting. However, I kept wondering where these characters were going. The last chapter wrapped everything up nicely for me, causing me to more closely consider the meanderings of the characters who I had lived with for the last month. It made sense. Tragic, lyrical and memorable, but not the greatest novel I have ever read."
1559,3,sometimes boring,"I read this book many years ago (in Spanish) and even if it keeps your attention and has great images and colorful descriptions it gets a little too boring. YOu want to flip some pages and keep going. Usually people who want to sound very ""literate"" try to talk you into it... be aware, is not the ""flowing through the pages"" type of book. Some understanding of the culture behind the whole story would be a good idea even before purchasing the book."
1560,4,Interesting,"An interesting book. Its a little confusing in its direction and scope though. Maybe not a must read, but pretty good overall. wwr@virginia.edu"
1561,3,Boring and confusing,"After 100 pages of reading, I cannot keep any of the characters straight and this is only part of the reason I've decided not to finish this book.It seems a waste to spend time on a book that up to this point has done literally nothing except try and leech as much interest out of a dull story by interweaving numerous eccentric characters into a really boring tale that most keeps me wondering WHY is it facinating that every other page Rebeca eats dirt (pica?)? Why should I find it romantic that an adult male virgin has fallen in love with a prepubescent child? Yuck!"
1562,2,uncannonized,"doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"
1563,2,Colombian family values -- part II,"Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what *may* be an atypical Colombian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilections.And speaking of predilections, Marquez, along with some other of intellectualdom's best and brightest, recently decided to weigh in on the Klinton-Lewinsky scandal (New York Times, Sep 26, 1998). I think this is entirely appropriate. When it comes to judging contemporary sexual mores, who better than Marquez to judge our beloved Bill?"
1564,5,One of the best books ever written,"I believe it's necessary to have some background in Spanish, Spanish American literature and Gabriel Garcia Marquez to truly comprehend the magnificence of this book. After reading the entire Don Quijote de la Mancha in Spanish for a college course, I actually thanked God that I decided to major in Spanish. I read Cien Anos de Soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude) twenty years later and I had the same reaction. For me, it is the masterpiece of the twentieth century."
1565,3,customer service is poor,I got the UCL-L model. The directions do not fit the product and what is on line also skip a few steps. Being very handy this was not an issue when installing my HP 42in. plasma to the mount. The price was 299.00 plus shipping. When I contacted custimer service at Omni mount they were at times rude and not one of them seemed to know the products features. A very uneasy and disapointing situation. Next time I will try Sanus but not sure if their product control would be much better. As it turned out the mount was better than the follow up I received from the Omni support staff.
1566,5,This is a serious mount!,"I am very pleased with this purchase. I did a lot of research and selected this mount because of OmniMount's reputation for quality. This is a very sturdy mount. It connects to 2 studs with 6 large bolts. I have a 46"" plasma TV and it isn't going anywhere! The TV looks great when flush against the wall, but it looks even better when I pull out the TV and turn it to the right or left.I installed this by myself, but it's probably a 2 person job. The instructions are not well written but you'll figure it out. The cable management is OK. If you have a lot of wires you'll quickly run out of space."
1567,4,Tough Mount,"This mount is great! I can swing the TV out to view it from different parts of my master bedroom. Mainly the TV is pushed up against the wall. But with little ease, you can move it to any position. You just grab the TV and swing it around. The mount holds all of the weight of the TV. So there is only a little resistance.There are only two BAD things I could think of...1. The TV does protrude from the wall quite a bit. From wall to the front of the TV is about 9 or 10 inches.2. It is rather difficult to angle the TV up and down. You actually have to unlock a spring component to do it."

1569,5,Eat Away Diabetes: Beat Type 2 Diabetes by Winning the Sugar,"I have been to SO many doctors and diabetes educators, but nowhere have I found such helpful hints and great recipes all in 1 place. I have tried a number of them in the last few weeks and they taste great and best of all, I am feeling much better.Thank you Ms. Napier! I will spread the word!"
1570,5,Funnier than I could ever have imagined,"I wonder if Discworld fans ever feel like they are in on a big happy secret, that people who think ""fantasy"" genre novels are beneath them aren't entitled to know.I guess I used to be one of those naysayers. My inherent interest level in dragons and trolls is not that high. But ""Men at Arms,"" the first Pratchett novel I've ever read, is the funniest most entertaining read I've had in years, in ANY genre.My only problem now is that I want to go right out and read the other 20+ novels ASAP, but fear I will lose my job because I am reading them under my desk at the office, and lose my husband because I wake him up laughing so hard while reading in bed.BTW if you want a real treat, try this (or other Pratchetts) on audio CD/cassette/download. The fellow doing the reading (Nigel Planer?) is a riot. Plus, if you listen in your car on the way to work, you can keep your job and your spouse."
1571,4,Not Bad,"I wanted a little MP3 player to wear around the house while I was cleaning. This fits the bill, and I love the clip on feature. I would've given this 5 stars except for the fact that the volume doesn't get terribly loud. Also, I don't like ear pods because they tend to fall out of my ears. I thought I'd just swap a pair of regular, ""walkman"" style headphones, but they won't fit. Too big. Come to find out these are 2.5mm headphones. It does come with some sort of adapter, but I think that's for even larger headphones, so it didn't work with what I had. All in all, it's a nice little player for $25. I suppose it's probably better that the volume doesn't get so loud (better for your hearing), but I still like my music kinda loud. Now I'm on the hunt for a pair of 2.5mm headphones that fit over your head and have a volume control on the cord. Not a bad deal overall."
1572,4,Lively Weekend Discussion,"When Strong Medicine first came out, I indicated to to my girl-friend that she might like it. Strong Medicine quickly became her favorite series. While I normally avoid spending time in front of the television, I made a point of sitting with my future wife on Sunday evenings to end the week with a provocative episode of Srong Medicine. We always seemed to have an inteligent and lively discussion on the issues presented. When the first year of episodes came out, I was pleased to order a copy for Valentine's day. My wife was thrilled and we both are looking forward to the release of the second season."
1573,2,Slow going,Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.
1574,2,Seasoned practitioners--don't bother,"This book is quite disappointing for those who are knowledgeable in this subject area. One new to the subject might find CE-VI serves as a quick (but weak)overview. In other words, Baldwin never addresses any one of the subject areas with depth. Each book chapter is only a summary of the area it addresses with a few very short case histories inserted. I would suggest all purchase ""Remarkable Healings: A Psychiatrist Discovers Unsuspected Roots of Mental and Physical Illness"" by Shakuntala Modi."
1575,2,Designer Dependent,"This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)"
1576,1,In-line Writing Style,"This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake."
1577,2,Rather outdated Swedish,"I suspect it has been some time since the author visited Sweden or even watched a Swedish movie. A quick glance through the phrases and translations gives me the feel of reading a novel from the 1940s. Using these phrases in Sweden will make you seem either comical or positively moronic.A few examples: Hardly anyone uses the antiquated polite form ""Ni"" any more. It might even be taken as an insult. This book uses it consistently. No Swede would ever say ""Var s god och ge mig resväskan"", which translates to something like ""You had better give me that suitcase"". The translation of ""may I introduce miss Svensson"" will sound hilarious in modern Sweden, unless you are auditioning for a part in a period movie from the second world war. If you are in search of an adaptor and ask for a ""transformator"" as suggested in this book, you would probably just get funny looks.Surely it must be possible to come up with something better than this?(For your information, I am Swedish.)"
1578,5,Narrative poetry at its best very comical,"Although the original version is somewhat difficult reading given that it was a poetic narrative in middle english this version is accessible to the average reader.The book is a collection of tales told by a group of travellers on their way to Canterbury. Each tale has some moral underpinning and develops themes of courtly love, morality and corruption of the religious establishments.The book is rife with symbolism especially in the description of garments facial features and scenery.Some of the tales are so tawdry that Danielle Steele would blush.Regardless, the book was very amusing and explored problems many of us face daily."
1579,3,"Stories are good, but syntax is lacking","While the 'Tales' in this volume are no less amusing and relevant, I would have preferred for it to have been read in Middle English, maintaining the original flow and meter (which is not that hard to understand after hearing it for a while)."
1580,2,Kindle version is very poorly edited,"The content - introductory notes, translation - is great. This is one of my favourite adaptations of the Canterbury Tales into modern English.The Kindle version, however, complete ruins the book. The printed version presents facing-page translation, which works great. The kindle version attempts to do that, having one 'page' after the other, not considering that due to the font-size adaptability, this doesn't work at all."
1581,5,This translation has it all.,"I really like this translation of the Chaucer classic. I like the fact that while being a modern language translation, it still keeps the work in verse form. I like the demonstrated ease of reading, my kids in English class like it for that reason. The older translations are good as well, but I feel the this translation is one that will allow Chaucer, and his stories to live on forever in the minds of modern readers. David Wright deserves just credit for making this available to the general readership.I will not review any of the stories because I think it wise to read them yourself and understand the truly effective use of irony in English writing."
1582,1,Why is Chaucer so great?,"Umm... Did not enjoy this book. Characters were almost all lewd and bad people, crooks and the like. One dimensional characters, all. The stories they told were sometimes interesting, at least."
1583,4,Great,"This is a good translation. Coghill has masterfully captured the essence of Chuacer. The tales never fail to amuse, enlgihten, and teach me about life. Note: Though this is poetry, there are NO line numbers."
1584,2,insufficient to teach this tonal language,"this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced."
1585,5,Beautiful but unbelievably sad,"This is a very good and moving film and, with it's sequel ""Manon des Sources"" is truely excellent. It is not necessary to watch the sequel to appreciate Jean de Florette, but you will have to watch this first to make any sense of the the characters' motivations in Manon.I just wanted to comment on the review that suggested that the film-maker's motivation in splitting the two parts was financial. Look closely - the sequel takes place some 10 years later and uses the same cast. The story had to be broken up to allow everyone - especially the child Manon - to age sufficiently to continue.These are a couple of amazing films."
1586,2,"Not the Space Program, Rather Mecury, Gemini and Apollo","I was greatly disappointed in this book. It is not about the space program, but rather about the MANNED space program: primarily Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. There is still a need for a short overall appreciation of the space program. Planetary exploration and space astronomy are missing, as are the applications: communications, weather, and remote sensing. T.A. Heppenheimer's recent book may be the best general work on space."
1587,5,Truth is more fascinating than fiction!,Charles Pellegrino is a born storyteller - and he's working with one of the most fascinating true stories of history. Who can resist that combination?

1589,5,THE GREATEST FILM SCORE IN THE HISTORY OF THE MOVIES,"THIS IS FANTASTIC SCORE FOR ANY KIND OF A MOVIE, NOT JUST A CHEESY JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE! THE SCORE FOR THIS MOVIE WAS NOT ON THE VERSION OF THE MOVIE THAT WAS RELEASED IN THE USA IN 1962. HAVING NEVER SEEN THE ORIGINAL, UNEDITED, JAPANESE VERSION OF THE MOVIE, I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS MOVIE SOUNDTRACK, IT INCLUDES EERIE, SCARY KIND OF MUSIC (YOU CAN ALMOST FEEL THE MONSTERS CREEPING UP ON YOU, RIGHT OUT OF THE OCEAN), TRADITIONAL JAPANESE PERCUSSION, POP MUSIC, CHANTING, A LITTLE TIN PAN ALLEY, BLUES, LOUNGE MUSIC, MILITARY MARCHES, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS COMING NEXT. I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY THE WHOLE THING............"
1590,5,Pulitzer Prize Winner,"Not really a review, but I collect Ellen Glasgow books. It should be noted in her bio here that she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1942 for In This Our Life. I don't see that book here on Amazon, but it should be since it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. I saw that some say her books are ""overwritten,"" but you must take them in the context of when they were written. She is a wonderful author and depicts life in the South and rural America extremely well. Her real gift is her insight into her characters and what makes all of us human."
1591,4,CHEESY BUT FUN,"THE SEARCHERS were one of five groups stamped as MERSEY BEAT groups during the BRITISH INVASION.Apart from THE BEATLES,easily the best group of the bunch,there were THE DAVE CLARK FIVE,GERRY AND THE PACEMAKERS,HERMAN'S HERMITS and THE SEARCHERS.All of those bands were essentially singles oriented.Notice how WHEN YOU WALK IN TO THE ROOM sounds like THE BEATLES I FEEL FINE.Still,some of their singles,all included here are part of the so called 1963-1966 era,and have that innocence that after 1967 will be lost forever.SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA LOVE AGAIN and EVERYBODY COME CLAP YOUR HANDS were probably their two best tunes.When THE SEARCHERS released SECONDHAND DEALER in 1967,the clean cut image went downhill, and JOHN WAYNE took his STETSON and shoot them all out,regaining the title of his most famous western."
1592,1,buyer beware...this product and the company are a rip-off,"this is a terrible product from a company that should not be in business. the scooter never worked...their solution was to send me a couple of neew components nad have me install. when that did not work, they had me run test after test after test...to no avail. the scooter does not work to this day. i filed a complaint with amazon...amazon did a lousy job of investigating and determined that the warranty was expired (30 day warranty!). of course it expired...they took a week each time to respond to my requests for help. the warranty was half over by the time i got the scooter after ordering it. i am disputing the charge through my credit card company, hope that gets my money back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY, I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXPERIECE THE SAME THINK I DID.BUYER BEWARE!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!"
1593,4,surprisingly good,"For those of you who watched the previews and think Coyote Ugly is a substitute for a soft-core porn movie, you'd be wrong. It's basically a ""chick-flick"" film where the heroine overcomes adversity (in Violet's case, shyness) to reach eventual success as a songwriter. The beautiful bartenders are thrown in there only to entice some of the male audience to come watch the film (they really are nice to look at). There's no skin shown, though there is quite a lot of ""exotic dancing"" in the movie. It's a rather cliche theme and you know how the movie will end half-way through watching it, but amazingly, you'll still find yourself enjoying the ending. Violet's adorably innocent face makes you care how she ends up, and the love scenes are touchingly sappy. Find yourself smiling after watching it."
1594,3,Coyote Ugly,"A decent but disappointing flick. It disappoints because it is definitely not as advertised. From the commercials, you'd think you're going to see a movie about a bar with outrageous female bartenders. The movie is actually about Violet who moves from Jersey to New York to become a song writer. After a burglary, she's broke and gets a job at the bar Coyote Ugly. You get occasional glimpses at the girls dancing on the bar and flinging water, drinks, and ice on their customers. Other than Violet, the other women at the bar aren't featured. You learn nothing about them. And if you're a Tyra Banks fan, don't bother watching this movie. She's on screen about ten minutes. That's a generous estimate. Mostly the movie is about Violet's attempts to get her music heard. It's sweet but not unique. The DVD has deleted scenes. Probably only one of them should have been saved. I would have given it four stars if I hadn't been so disappointed."
1595,4,Love this movie,We've watched this movie three times. It's very entertaining and will keep you interested. It's probably more for younger or middle age people with an open mind. We are in our 60's and really liked it. I don't think it's for kids under 10 years of age.
1596,4,Greg's Review,I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
1597,4,A decent movie after all....,"I bought this movie because of the unbeatable price for my psp. My husband and I both own the device (psp) and use it quite often while traveling. Coyote Ugly is a great ""girlie"" movie you can watch over and over again."
1598,5,Exciting,"Entertaining comedy with Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia. The bashful Violet comes from the province to the turbulent New York, in order to realize, despite her terrible stage fright, her dream of a song writer. She finds support in the charming Kevin. She works in Coyote Ugly"", the most hip club in town. After lots of obstacles she faces her first performance."
1599,1,Absolutely horrible!,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year (right there with ""The Whole Nine Yards"" and ""Cruel Intentions""). The plot is predictable, the actors worthless (or maybe the plot just wasn't any good), and there's really no good reason to watch it. See, if this movie were at least rated R and they actually showed some T&A instead of just hinting at it, maybe there'd be a reason to watch this movie, what with all the hotties in it. However, bad dialogue, combined with predictable plot, bad performances by actors and hotties but no nudity makes for a totally worthless movie. What a waste of my time!"
1600,2,Make it Stop!,"My roomate bought this dvd, thinking that it would be fun and mindless, along the lines of Bring It On or such. It was a terrible disapointment. We were prepared for chics dancing on bars and related craziness, but it was actually a slow-moving story about a country girl who moves to the Big Apple to become a songwriter but is afraid to sing in public. By the end you will be begging her to sing the (explicative deleted) song! In conclusion, make another selection at the video store!"
1601,5,Coyote Ugly,I usually dont give reviews of movies becuase everyone else does and it sums up what I have to say but I read the reviews for this movie and was very dissapointed. I went three times to see this moive. It was exectly every time I saw it. I even bought the soundtrack which was wonderful. The movie was Awsome. It shows how you should never give up on anything that you really want -boy or girl- becuase it can be acheived. I belive that everyone should see this movie!!
1602,2,Pretty Girls with a thin plot,The movie stars Piper Perabo who is a very likeable actress. The only problem is that she is stuck with boring dialog and a weak plot. If you are going to make a movie about a crazy bar and the lifestyle of a young bartender in New York City why would you make it PG-13. How wild and crazy can you get. Its kind of ironic that the cover of this movie reminds me of a Spice Girls poster. Stay away from this one if you have any interest in a plot and charachters.
1603,4,A Great Sexy Movie!,"All the reviews said bad acting but beautiful women. I think both were great. This movie is based on a girl that wants to be a singer but has terrible stage fright. She goes to work in a bar, ""Coyote Ugly"" and this is where the beautiful women come in. They get their money by dancing on the bar. She makes the cut, but then has to make up $300 to stay. She does it and also makes her first singing appearance here. There is also the love story that is tangled in. She gets caught up with a guy that says he's a producer, but he isn't. But they make up and end up together. Despite her fathers disagreements, she continues to stive for her goal to be a singer. She ends up with the guy and the ability to sing on stage in a happy ending. Overall, this is a very sexy movie with an interesting plot, including Leanne Rimes giving a private concert at the bar. The dancing and singing is great and I recommend this as a good date movie."
1604,1,One of the most unbelievably vapid things I've ever seen,"I was trapped on a bus recently, and forced to watch this movie. An excuse to put hot, young Hollywood PG-13 girl flesh all over the screen. The fact that this movie has a high average rating is just another indicator that the pundits are right when they say the educational system is failing..."
1605,4,"One of the best albums of the decade, easily.","I'll keep this short. Every song on 2.0 is good and most of them border on great or better. Its an album you can listen to from start to finish and not have to skip past filler. My only complaint is that the lyrics, after a while, are a bit unfulfilling. They are always interesting, but once in a while its like ""Say something meaningfull!"". Not that the songs are devoid of meaning, but its nice to hear a storyline or at least a continuation of the same thought throughout the song. This is especially apparent on ""When I Grow Up"". Anyhow, this is still a great album and I'm very thankfull that Garbage made it. By the way, Shirley is wonderfull and essential, but your confused if you dont think that its the whole band that makes it work. Shirley and the rest of them couldnt do what they do without each other."
1606,5,This CD rules!,"I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."
1607,2,Ditch the Producer,"Garbage's first, self-titled, album was extraordinary. ""2.0"" is an overproduced, watered-down, record-label-spawned creation that's not worthy of the band. It's not that it's bad - it's that it's not good, and you'll be better off listening to the first album a hundred times rather than the first fifty times and this one fifty times.My advice to the band? Ditch the big-name producer and get back into a studio on your own, playing on your own. There, hopefully, you'll find what you lost in between the first and second albums."
1608,2,I was disappointed,"Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are."
1609,5,Words can't explain it...,"This CD is soooo... GOOD!!! This is one of my favorite CDs. The songs are so BOMB!!:) I especially like ""Temptation Waits"", ""Sleep Together"", ""When I Grow"", and ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"". THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD!!! You will NEVER get tired of listening to this! I also recommend Garbage's 1995 CD, ""Garbage""."
1610,5,Album of the Year,This is one of the best CDs of the year. Garbage does all different types of music well.
1611,5,"one word ""HECTIC""",brilliant but some songs r really overplayed well i suppose that comes with fame (lol) :) hate the front cover though its just plain mean
1612,2,Changed too much in too little time.,"The band tried to pioneer a little too much into dance and electronica too early. Though ""The Trick..."" was the only good song with their new sound, ""Hammering..."" and ""Sleep Together"" seem to be overusing the guitar sound, ruining two of the twelve songs.If Garbage wants to adjust their sound a little bit, they should stick to the elements of ""Special"" and ""The Trick..."" and go from there."
1613,3,Disapointing follow up,"Garbage's first CD was one of the best to come out of the 90's. A brilliant amazing record. Version 2.0 is laboured and lacks any soul or human connection. Its better than 80% of music out there today, but it can't touch the first record. I hope this is a minor blip in what I'm sure is going to be an amazing body of work."
1614,2,Paranoiac...,This record gives one a nightmare. This kind of music needs to stay in the nineties where it belongs.
1615,5,Beware when buying this CD!!!,"I'd love to write a critical review of this CD, but sadly I've never heard this version. I've been trying unsuccessfully for more than a year to order it, and each time I've received the wrong CD: specifically, the Japanese import with extra track ""Push It-- Boom Boom Satellites Remix"" instead of extra tracks ""Lick The Pavement"" and ""Thirteen."" Apparently, there's a universal ISBN snafu surrounding these two imports.I thought ordering from one of Amazon Marketplace's vendors would be a better way to go, but I've just received another wrong CD from one of them and I'm so frustrated I could spit kittens.I'm sure the extra tracks are as good as the rest of the album we all got to hear in the States, so I gave the import 5 stars. But if you order it, be prepared for a long wait and a big hassle returning the incorrect CDs you receive. Good luck!"
1616,4,Garbage's Live Performance Dwarfs Album,"I saw Garbage live recently. I already had ""Garbage"" and ""Version 2.0,"" and thought they were good, but a little weak. After seeing the band live I was thoroughly convinced that their talent is great. Garbage literally ROCKED! Shirley Manson tore the house down with her energy and gutsy vocals. The other members were as energetic and their sound reflected that energy. I only wish their sound came across so well on their albums."
1617,5,best garbage ever,"version 2.0 is the best cd ever! they have great music, clean, upbeat, and you won't get sick listening to it over and over...this is the cd to listen to on the subways, it makes your trip go alot faster...and somehow takes your mind to somewhere else, especially the last half of the cd...i recommend this to anyone who's into that urban pop music...it's not too hardcore and not to mellow, great for one of those days when you just want to get out of the city or wherever you are.."
1618,4,This Garbage doesn't stink.,"It sounds so simple -- write perfect little pop songs, then throw a bunch of sound effects, tape loops and squealing guitars over it. Simple it's not, but ""Version 2.0"" has perfected that formula. There are no less than six radio-ready singles off this album. And supervixen singer Shirley Manson has never sounded better ... or sexier."
1619,5,AWESOME!,"Let's face it,Garbage's self-titled '95 alblum was increadable, but with Version 2.0 they have outdone themselves (and in my opinion they have also outdone most all of the other top bands out there.) V 2.0 is by far the best CD I own. So, for anyone who is a fan of unique lyrics and song stylings and the angry demeanor and personality of lead singer Shirley Manson, buy this alblum now. You won't be disappointed."

1622,1,It didn't work.,It didn't work. I was excited that it came in fast. but the game does not work. it made my kids sad. Waste of money. I do not recommend buying this game. First time it happened to me. Good luck if you decide to buy it.
1623,1,Be aware!,This cd does not work for a european cd player!They should have warned me when buying from Europe.I am not satisfied with it.
1624,1,Lousy,"Jane Fonda way over-acts, and the direction and production values are just one step above made-for-television level."
1625,5,Continuing enjoyment through the years,"This has been a favorite film since my first viewing when it was initially released. The tension of the times and the quality of acting combine to reflect Hellman's personal experience. I wanted to add it to my very select library of film, now available on DVD."
1626,4,Point and Click Crime Solving!,"Right off the bat I'll confess that I am a fan of point and click games AND I'm a fan of crime solving games. So, from that, you can tell that this game was right up my alley.The graphics are a bit bland, and you WILL get stuck. You WILL end up talking to each person about each scrap of paper in your inventory. You WILL drag the cursor over each minute pixel looking for that one smear of oil or dried blood stain you need. But when that final cinematic plays and justice is wrought at your judicial hands, dang, it is all worth it.Also, the writing is actually really good. There's a lot of twists to the cases and I was intrigued by how they would turn out.If you have the patience, or if you're looking for some murders (and an arson or two) to solve, this is you cup of tea."
1627,5,Yoga for Anyone,"The scenery is so enjoyable and the music is fantastic. Peggy shows us that we all can do yoga, regardless of fitness level. The exercises are great even if you don't surf as we all need to be flexible. As an Occupational Therapist, I am interested in safe yoga exercises, rather than celebrity exercises and Peggy delivers a safe viable option to increasing your range of motion.Surf Flex: Flexibility, Yoga, and Conditioning Exercises for Surfers"
1628,2,Nothing especially helpful for surfing,"This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class."
1629,5,Yoga for Surfers,"This is awesome!! (The kook below who didn't understand the video obviously didn't watch it -- yoga in wetsuits at Pipeline?!?) Anyway, it is a great program -- the first time I've seen yoga and surfing combined, and it is beautiful! Taylor and Rochelle rip! I've already felt looser and stronger in my surfing and yoga with this program. BUY THIS DVD and and see for yourself (and forget the dude who wants to do surf-yoga with Ali McGraw!)"
1630,2,Biography of a Grissly by Seton,"I didn't realize that there was no illustrations in the book and Seton was a very fine illustrator, so why would you publish one of his books without the illustrations?"

1633,3,Good Service,"I got what I ordered quickly. Wasn't exactly what I needed for the test I took, but it was exactly what I ordered"
1634,4,A standard reference,This book is a must for the bookshelves of treasure hunters and armchair dreamers. The history of lost gold and hidden treasures in the American Southwest is summarized here as well as it can be.
1635,2,Read as fiction,You know -- this is ok -- but- I am an excellent researcher and I have not been able to verify anything that is in this book
1636,4,Detailed Survey of WWII Air War,"We all know the important role of the AAF in WWII, but most books and movies focus on the ground war. The battles in the sky, often involving thousands of aircraft, are hard to imagine in the day of precision bombing that requires but a tiny fraction of aircraft of the campaigns in WWII. From the creation of the AAF, to the horrors of air battles, to the targets destroyed, this book will fill in student of WWII and aviation with an important chapter of history that is unlikely ever to be repeated. Strategic bombing alone didn't win the war, but without it, the cost to the Allies would have been far greater."
1637,4,Nice Experience.,"This is my first Lou Reed Video. I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I have gained some new perspective on Lou's music. He is a true professional. Before I turned it on, I knew I would like my favorites, Sweet Jane and Walk on the Wild Side, but I found myself enveloped in the other songs, which I had never heard before. I was a casual Lou Reed Fan.I think if I liked it, then a real hardcore fan will love it.The video is high quality and the sound is great, it's like having a front row seat. I'm glad I purchased this one."
1638,1,Just because she couldn't do it,"Doesn't mean other women can't. This is complete drivel. There are thousands of happy children of working moms (myself included) who would disagree with the author that working moms somehow can't be good mothers.Furthermore, this is classic Michelle Bachmann hypocrisy. If the author truly believes that women are best off staying at home and washing dishes, perhaps she shouldn't be writing a book. Her husband should be the author.In the meantime, leave the working moms who can pull it off alone."
1639,1,Piece of garbage!,"The title says it all! I will no longer listen to Dr. Laura nor the anti-working mommy ideals that the author professes! How is it that Dr. Laura works? What about the author, was she not taking away from her children when she wrote this book? I guess it is easy to preach to common folks when you are successful and do not need to work. Preach it somewhere else!"
1640,2,Failed expectations,"I have some acne scars around my face and I was hoping that this product would provide any assistance with it.It in fact did nothing to the appearance and through the weeks that I used it, I started to even break out in acne. I had more acne appearing on my skin than the months preceding this product. Completely disappointed but what can I expect from products in America"
1641,5,Bought this as a gift and they are very pleased with it,I bought this for my sister and my brother-in-law for christmas and they love it. My sister has been making cookies just to have some to put in the cookie jar.
1642,3,"Masterton's take on ""The Dreams in the Witch-House""","Masterton borrows characters from Lovecraft's short story, ""The Dreams In the Witch-House"", for this unmistakably Mastertonian novel. What I mean is that if you are a Lovecraft fan (and I am not as familiar with Lovecraft as I am with Masterton), don't expect this novel to be in Lovecraft's style. This is a Masterton novel, which means it is full of gory violence and gratuitous sex.Sometimes with Masterton, you have to enjoy the ride because you may not like the destination. I am giving this novel three stars because the ride was lots of fun. Masterton loves to come up with new ways to disgust you with gore and guts, and then titillate you with some sex. Meanwhile, he gives you a clue here and there about why strange things are happening but doesn't give it all away.But sometimes his endings go a bit haywire, and I think that's what happened here. So if you are a Masterton fan, enjoy the ride. If you are a Lovecraft fan, you've been warned."
1643,1,blleeuurrgghhhh,"i have listened to this single and i want to feed it to the garbage can man. I urge you to avoid it at all costs, you will not notice the insipidly simple tune working it's way into the core of your being and thus transform you into a similar state of insipid simplicity. For kylie minogue i can find many uses - for her music i find none."
1644,3,Not his best work.....,"We saw Gary live and he was absolutely hilarious, so we wanted to buy his material. This DVD has so so quality and isn't his best material (as far as comedy). I would pass on this one and buy a more recent DVD."
1645,4,gary owen,"I like this comedian, which is why I purchased. However, the item I received had no picture, just sound. He was funny without the picture."
1646,3,It was ok but there movies are a little too young for me.,"OK this movie was really kinda cheesy, I'm 13 and feel that many of their movies are geered for 8 yearolds after watching them, this one was ok, because i felt i could relate to some of the parts, but all the same i still felt it was a little cheesy and young for me, so if your 8-12 you would probably like it, but I would never watch it again."
1647,1,Too Typical,"You think that since these girls had done so many movies, they would have least done something more original than the ""twin"" switch. They would not have been as successful as they are if they were not born twins, but they should still be more creative. I did not like this movie, and the acting was not good at all. It was a huge disappointment."
1648,3,Interesting......,"The first and only time I saw this was on Animal Planet during 'Woah Sunday!'. I'm sad to say watching Mo almost beat the special. But I only saw the last half of it or so, even less probaly. This was interesting, seeing what it might be like in a certain amount of million years from now. But this was nothing special either. The CGI was terrible, movies such as Jurassic Park had better, and that was over 10 years bbefore this was made! The names they gave the creatures were highly laughable at, and even thinking of the few names I remember(which are Flish, Giant land squid, and the other land squid) send me into a short giggle fit.Basiclly, this is nothing extreme. Maybe a buy, but I suggest waiting for it to come on 'Woah Sunday!' again so you can compare it to Mo's side show. Or rent it."
1649,4,"It`s not really science, but it is entertaining","To say that this is not really science is an understatement. When you get right down to it, it`s just speculation. But when dealingwith the question of what path future evolution might follow, the wild guess speculations found in this film are probably asgood of wild guesses as any are.It`s not science or even what you could call a real documentary, but it is entertaining. And the critters discribed are by nomeans impossible. There is plenty of food for thought here. The critters and their environments are well thought out and possible,even if they are not probable.Trying to predict the future path of evolution is very much like trying to predict next weeks lottery numbers. Your guess will likelybe wrong, but your guess is likely no worse than anyone else`s guess."
1650,3,Iffy science but pretty pictures,"This DVD set is very entertaining-- funny, I should say. The science is faulty, it's set on hypothesis only, rarely on scientific fact. I am a college student and me and my friend found multiple errors in scientific facts. The animals that evolved were too specialized in the present to have evolved so radically. The names are uncreative but hilarious.We did enjoy watching this, mostly for laughs and to feel intelligent. The graphics are rather nice though, and I applaud the creators of this ""documentary"" for that."
1651,5,"Seems Crazy, but is Amazingly Sound","""The Future is Wild"" is based on scientific assumptions as to what will live on Earth in millions of years from now. This series is not as far-fetched as it seems. Scientists comment through the whole series and explain how and why these animals might evolve. Some of the theories seem insane like their idea that squid will take the place of humans as the dominant species on the planet, but the way the scientists explain these possibilities, the idea becomes understandable, and even possilble. ""The Future is Wild"" is a great series, but if you have a short attention span, I wouldn't watch it. I hope this review was helpful and I hope you enjoy ""The Future is Wild""!NOTE: Creationists SHOULD NOT watch!"
1652,5,the future is wild,I bought this dvd for my son who has been wanting it since he saw it on TV. He loved it and has watched it many times since he got it.
1653,4,Was Interesting,"My 6 year old wanted this series so I ordered it. We don't have cable so when we saw a little piece of this series at a pizza place, we thought, hey...looks interesting.My son enjoyed it and I did as well. I wouldn't have purchased this if I had seen it on cable, but my son has had fun sharing with others what the future may hold.It did fire up a discussion about traveling through time both past and future and my son has decided he will invent that machine just to really see what's up with the future. So from that standpoint it was fun and helped stir up quite a fun discussion and spark a 6 year old boy's imagine to go wild.If you don't like watching other things eat other things, you may want to keep the remote handy...other than that...it's worth a watch at least one time."
1654,2,Buyer BEWARE,"This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase"
1655,1,Use with caution!,"Poor chemists -- don't you wish a book existed that could meet your needs at this level? This book, as previously noted, contains more errors than you probably made on your last organic chemistry exam. Some mistakes are obvious, but I highly recommend avoiding this book because even the little things may mislead you. If you are looking to study for the GRE, I recommend picking up the Harcourt Brace College Outline Series books on College Chemistry and Physical Chemistry if you haven't already. If you want a book to study for organic chemistry, try finding a Kaplan MCAT book on organic chemistry, or at least one that has an organic chemistry section. As for instrumentation and inorganic, go back and ask friends or reread your notes and textbooks."
1656,1,nothing but errors in this book,"I agree completely with the other reviews of this book. I just spent an hour deriving and re-deriving the Henderson-Hasselbach equation, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The previous review tells me what I need to know -- it is incorrect in this book!!! There are so many errors that it is actually more work to review material that I already know than it was to learn it the first time. It's a shame I can't give zero stars on this review."
1657,1,Monkies on typewriters,"You know how they say that an infinite number of monkies on an infinite number of typewriters would eventually produce Hamlet?Well, for this book, I'd guess that Dr. Laberge employed 3 monkies for 10 minutes."
1658,1,This book is the worst you could use for your GRE prep,"This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it."
1659,1,Consider American Made Products,"Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American."
1660,2,Knock Off,I am upset to see that this is a knock off. How is it legal for them to sell this? I guess amazon does not care to protect it's buyers...
1661,4,simple fun,Both my 4-year-old and 1-year-old love this game. It's simple rules and no setup makes it easy to play and understand. The kids find the suspense very exciting. I will say that both my kids were able to pull the top jaw off of the crocodile in attempts to force the mouth closed. Fortunately it easily snapped back on.
1662,4,Cute toy,"We found this at a thrift store for 50 cents. Needless to say it is worth what I paid. It keeps my under 5-yr-old crowd enthralled. My 16-month-old enjoys it the most, so I don't believe it's very scary. I played with it first and laughed at it closing down on my hand. Don't know if that cut out the scariness factor, or if my kids just weren't scared of this toy to begin with."
1663,2,Not what I expected,"When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun. My 4 year old broke it in less than a week, but we were not too upset! Not a bad toy for a road trip, but owuldn't recommend it for a family game."
1664,2,Not as durable as I thought it would be.,"The crocodile dentist worked as it should for about one week. Great concept, but too flimsy. Pushing any of the teeth makes the croc chomp down. Not supposed to work that way."
1665,2,broken in days,"I bought this for my 3 yr old and at first, he thought it was the best game ever and laughed when the croc would chomp down on his fingers. Then, the top part of the mouth kept falling off and I had to keep putting it back on until it just completely broke and wasn't able to play it again. I think it lasted at tops for a full week in our house and that was it. So, definintely doesn't hold up well at all!"
1666,3,Crocodile Dentist,"I purchased this toy for my grandson with Special Needs. When my son went to school for his review they told him how much this toy was enjoyed by the kids including my grandson, however it was old and they couldn't find a replacement. When I found this one on Amazon, I got 3. One for the school, one for playing with at his home and the last one for playing at my home. He hasn't played with it here yet but will after the excitement of the holidays is over."
1667,2,"Very small, flimsy and not working properly",Head gets stuck and does not snap. Very small and flimsy. I was disappointed with this and kids have not played with it at all. Should have taken heed to the other reviews which stated same.
1668,1,Horrible,"My 4 year old hates this toy. Not only does it pinch when it snaps shut, but the same tooth triggers the snap every time. It didn't take him long to figure out which tooth NOT to pick. This toy was a huge disappointment this Christmas."
1669,5,tougher then it looks,"My kids received this toy as a gift and at first I thought it wouldn't last more then a few weeks, but the toy is more durable then it looks. My kids have played it for months and its been dropped repeatedly on the floor, and its held up. Its a good game for younger players as well because it's quick and can hold their attention for the duration. My older kids ages 6 and 8 enjoy playing it also. for the price you can't really go wrong."
1670,1,Purchased twice-never worked,My 4 year old used his piggy bank money to purchas this toy. We could not get the mouth to chomp down no matter how many teeth we pushed in any order. We returned it for a new one from a different seller& had the same problem. Very disappointed.
1671,1,awful,"I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1672,4,This guy has got SKILLS,"This is a really good album! If you're into rap you'll love this! There is also a song w/ Juvenile and BG from Cash Money Records...trust me, Chino is from my home town of Akron, and he delivers, definately!"
1673,5,Great Show,"The first 3-4 episodes of this show were absolute perfection. The latter episodes are not as tight as the first ones, but they still stand strong. I'm so happy they finally officially released this. I purchased an amazing copy on Ebay, of which I am still indebted to the guy who made those copies. They were near perfect and allowed to get a few of my friends addicted to the show years after it was taken off the air. I will admit that I wanted more 'behind the scenes' stuff, but once again, we are very lucky we have anything. This is a great show and probably the best show/cartoon MTV ever put on the air."
1674,5,Original and funny-pretty well the basis why shows dont last.,"What an amazing and funny show, much like Arrested Development and Family Guy (just to name the obvious) it didnt make it. Family guy has rebounded. Clone High ended way to early to have a chance to do anything. Regardless, I really want to have these episodes at home to enjoy, it's a fun way to see western adolescent culture roles intertwined with some of histories must influential and important people. Original and funny, pretty well Why it didnt have a chance."
1675,1,Where in the world is the original mix?,"I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."
1676,4,Sounds great - Still Looks The Same,"Of course, this is a classic concert and whatever quality it encompasses should be forgiven. But what's to forgive? First, the sound has been remastered and really is a major improvement over the previous film. It really was the ""Spiders"" last concert and needs to be seen as that, in a historical perspective. The cinematography is, well...less grainy, but the camera is still bouncing quite a bit. You can't have everything! If you are a purist and just cannot stand an imperfect film, then take a pass. Otherwise, this is a great collection of fifteen songs from ""Hunky Dory"" and ""Ziggy Stardust..."" (plus some) presented at the height of glam rock when glam rock really mattered. In that respect, not many others than Bowie really did."
1677,2,Agree with Maltin,"I am a Bowie fan and I found this unlistenable and almost unwatchable. Pennebaker obviously had a very low budget, and probably the film sat around for years before he pieced it together in a lame moment. I enjoyed seeing the different costume changes most..."
1678,1,You must be a Bowie fanatic to recomend this dvd...,"As a David Bowie fan of his earlier music, I was extremely disappointed by this ""presentation"". Poor music selection, terrible arrangements, sound quality befitting old 8mm home movies, and grainy picture. I believe this was shot with 2 hand held cameras focusing exclusively on Bowie, almost completely ignoring his band members. Do NOT waste your money on this dvd!!!"
1679,3,Fine for what it is...,"I got this pack for my 3 year old who is very interested in 'gadgets' - compasses, watches, etc. I got it b/c it had alot of these things and was pretty inexpensive and thought it would be fun for him to open. I will say that he and his brother have enjoyed it, in particular the binoculars and the compass watch - and they run filling the pack with different things and going on adventures. Its absolutely fine for what it is, but nothing amazing! I would buy it again."
1680,2,pretty but delicate,"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."
1681,4,Response to review by karen b,"FYIWith Windows XP you can run programs in what is called 'compatibility mode', and one of the compatibility modes you can choose is Windows 95.To do this, install the program, then find a shortcut to the program (in the program's start menu folder, on the desktop...). Then right-click on the shortcut and select ""Properties"" from the popup menu. In the Properties dialog, select the ""Compatibility"" tab. In that tab, check the box labeled ""Run this program in compatibility mode for:"" and select the appropriate Windows version from the dropdown list (in this case, Windows 95). Click ""OK"" until all the dialog boxes are gone. The program should now work just fine. I run several older programs on Windows XP, and I use this for all of them."
1682,1,Beware,"I cannot rate this item since I cannot load it, it will NOT run on Windows XP, you must have Windows 95 which makes it pretty much obsolete. It does not say this clearly in the product description"
1683,3,"Buena pieza literaria pero cruel, despiadada","Ésta no es una novela para pasar un rato agradable.En la historia aparecen muchos símbolos o representaciones sobre la sociedad humana y esto puede ser interesante para varios lectores, pero la esencia de la novela es cruda, fuerte, inmisericorde.El hecho de que los protagonistas sean jóvenes no la convierte automáticamente en literatura juvenil. Sugiero leerla antes de recomendarla o regalarla."
1684,2,Not nearly enough detail,"It seems as if the author tried to get the book out the door as quickly as possible. If you are totally new to Tomcat, then you can read the book, but there is not much substance at all for anyone trying to actually implement Tomcat."
1685,5,Excellent Coverage for the Developer,"I picked this text up three days ago and I am very pleased with everything I have read. It really takes the angle of administering the Tomcat server with the developer in mind.Some of the areas that I found most useful included coverage of Servlet Filters and Tomcat Valves, a chapter on embedded Tomcat applications, and a great Appendix covering the server.xml file.I recommend this book for any developer, or administrator, looking for the fast track to using Tomcat."
1686,3,Apache Jakarta-Tomcat,Good in the sense that it is compact and offers a high-level overview of JSP and Servlets-but not enough examples to allow you to design professional apps. This is not a good book for a detailed description of how to configure Tomcat.
1687,1,Yuck!,"I never would have bought this except that I lost the copy I naively borrowed from the library, and I needed a replacement copy. I tried twice to watch it, and both times quit in disgust."
1688,1,A gay old man chasing a straight young man. That's it.,"First, forget anything about ""Frankenstein."" This movie is nothing more than a story of a gay old man chasing a straight young man. And it dragged on and on...If this movie had been about a straight man chasing a younger woman, it would have been reviewed as garbage.I agree totally with the review titled ""God, This Movie's A Monster!""For what it's worth, the cinematography was good."
1689,4,See this movie just for Ian McKellen's performance!,"""Gods and Monsters"" is a superb movie about the last days of gay film director James Whale -- who directed ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"". The acting is superb, especially Ian McKellan in the lead. I thought it dragged in a few areas, but on the whole it was a great movie."
1690,5,POWERFUL & WONDERFULLY FILMED,"I never really knew of Mr. Whales' history as an ""out"" director, at a time when homosexuality was ""swept under the rug"", ,considered a sickness , & VERY hush-hush.The 3 main characters could not have been played any better. In my opionion, Ms. Redgraves finest performance, and Sir Ian's as well.Brendan Fraser was perfectly cast as the gardner whose physical stature somewhat resembles ""Frankenstien"" to Sir Ians' James Whale. The photogrpahy, direction, sets,costumes, and the remarkable resemblance of stars gone by are what makes this film 1 of my all-time faves."
1691,5,Great Movie!!!!,I think that was an awesome movie! I am a total fan of Brad Renfro and I have seen all of his movies. He is THE greatest actor I have ever seen in the movies. Everyone should see this movie.
1692,2,"Boring, boring, boring!","Perhaps I'm just reacting to how old this is, but I found it to be boring. Yet I've watch others made in that time and they are still enjoyable and very interesting. I couldn't get into this one at all and felt that I was about three or four steps ahead of the plot all the way along."
1693,3,Getting Better!,"The latest edition of ""Interchange"" is certainly an improvement on the original. Teachers who have been using the old book for years will be relieved to see agonizing sections from the old book removed. And the subject material and sequencing of grammar,listening and speaking activities is better too. The workbook is also vastly superior to the old workbook . However, one of the major weaknesses of the old book still remains-the Teacher's Book. The lack of an abundance of really good speaking and grammar activities forces the teacher to do a large amount of preparation work. Here's a tip- supplement Interchange with Heinemann's ""Reward Resource Books""."
1694,5,Exceptional Learning and Understanding!,"Highly recommended for day-care centers and early-learning centers for story-time. Very helpful to all children especially bi-racial and foreign nationals. Also a great start for the younger children--they understand everything!!!Dr. Henderson..... ""you go, girl"""
1695,1,Trading one bad habit for another,"Crystal Phillips gained sooo much self-esteem she had a long term affair with my spouse, which led to years of tension in my family(didn't know why at the time)...WOW Crystal...I can think of a few titles for your next book. I even remember our chance meeting....it's a small world after all!"
1696,5,Brilliant!,"This is a truly brilliant book. It enables the reader to learn what he has been doing right and wrong in his relationship life.Every man who wants to develop his ideal relationship with his girlfriend/wife must read, learn and live this book."
1697,3,"1 "" of Boring","I bought it to read about the man's unusual character, not baseball jargon and statistics (although I'm sure it is accurate.) The 1st 2/3 is as dry as army meatloaf. IMHO not told with the right touch of humor if any. Eventually it covers his personality, but why do I feel like it is Tuvok describing an alien?"
1698,5,"The Babe, Bigger than Life","The title of the book describes what you will find inside, his life. He was a legend which to this day is the standard ball players are being compaired. The book is well written, does not bog you down, keeps your interest from beginning to end. It describes his life, both on and off the field in a slightly different light than what we may have heard and seen growing up in the 60's as I did. I enjoyed the book, the history, the stories (true or not!) and the effect he had on the game of baseball. It's a good read, especially if you are a baseball/history nut."
1699,1,for laser printers only,"This product is for laser printers only.You cannot put one of these transparencies into your home printer / injet printer, it will not print.The ink will bubble up.I sent back my order and still have not yet received my refund."
1700,3,Overhead Transparencies,"These transparencies work well using overhead markers on them. If you want to make the transparencies on your computer, the printer ink does not dry, even after sitting out for a week."
1701,2,Blah......,What a bunch of adolescents. All pretty self-serving. And dissappointing. I don't think friendship is too awfully deep when you screw around with your best friend's husband. Kind of a book about 30 year olds not wanting to grow up - forget the fact that their dear friend has died. And talk about a suffocating mother....YIKES! This book is mediocre at best.
1702,4,Big Chill in Little London,"A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."
1703,2,A little disappointed...,"Am I the only one who didn't like this movie? Sure, it was an original idea and the revelation of how Jude died was surprising, to say the least. Still, it was very slow-moving and even though Ray Whinstone was very good and Jude Law looked as hot as ever, there wasn't much else to hold my attention. The female leads all acted as if this were the first time they had read their lines - Sadie Frost, in my opinion, was terrible! Surely they could have found some actresses who would show a little emotion and seem sincere when they did show a little emotion. So, I give this film kudos for such an original idea and the unique way in which it was filmed and presented, but otherwise, I have to give it two thumbs down :-("
1704,5,Mosbys medical dictionary,"Excellent dictionary has every term that you need, I use it everyday for school plus for my own at home, great explanations and pictures."
1705,5,Best Medical Dictionary By Far!,I love this text it is filled with great pictures to help you understand what they are talking about. It also has easy to understand reading. Very thuroughly put together!
1706,4,Some things not scifi anymore,"Think about the episode in the beginning when Matt's phone rings in the middle of a crowd. ""So what, his parents called his cellphone"" you may say. However, this was just pure fantasy in 1948."
1707,1,Misses the Point,"I was hugely disappointed with this book. It held such promise of addressing one of the most important barriers to building collaborative behavior in organizations---the behavior of the senior people.Throughout the book the author seemed to defend the hierarchical behavior of senior executives and diminish team benefits. And it completely missed the essence of teams which is collaboration. Phrases such as ""amorphous groups with overlapping responsibilities,"" ""disrupt the natural order of things,"" ""seldom the best way to get normal work accomplished or routine problems solved,"" ""seldom the fastest way for a group with an experienced, capable leader to get where they are going,"" ""time-consuming 'forming, norming, and storming' stuff,"" had me wondering if the author really understands collaboration.This book may do more to maintain the traditional topdown, hierarchical decision making model than to foster real collaboration and teamwork."
1708,5,Required reading for understanding American politics,"Wawro's book studies a critical, and often overlooked, part of the legislative process: why do members draft and push bills through the legislature? While this might sound like a question with an obvious answer, Wawro points out that legislative entrepreneurship is costly and risky behavior. So why do legislators bear the costs and risks to draft and press bills?Wawro uses a combination of theoretical and empirical studies to test for four important possible factors which might lead legislators to become policy entrepreneurs: to gain support from their constitutents, to help campaign fundraising, to facilitate their position in the legislature, and partisan explanations. While I won't ruin the punchline for interested readers, I will promise that you'll be surprised at the answers which Wawro produces.If you want to understand contemporary American politics, you'll want to read Wawro's excellent book."
1709,4,Good Bed,Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.
1710,2,Disappointed,"I love this video unfortunately it doesn't show on a Blue Rays DVD player. Which means I can't enjoy it :( I was a bit frustrated. However, other purchases in the past have been great through Amazon."
1711,2,Looks & feels like a bootleg product.,"My copy even has an arrow pointer on the front cover picture! Talk about lousy merchandising. No Dolby, much less DTS, only a PCM Stereo recording. Video is average. Like proper packaging and presentation were no more than an afterthought.All in all, this looks like a bootleg edition. And no, it's an official release. Amazing. Messy. What were they thinking?"
1712,4,Nice for auto organization,"We purchased two of these. They fold up easily, but when they are set up, they hold quite a bit. We put one inbetween the driver & passenger seats of our van. It seemed like we always had stuff sitting there, so I wanted it a bit more organized. I think this product was worth the price, and it works well for us. It shipped quickly."
1713,4,Nice!,"Pretty music, but the stereo sound is not as spacious as I would desire. I found that tinkering with the equalizer settings, etc. seems to help some. Another version of this music by Victor Fedetov has gorgeous sound, but less of the ballet than on this cd. I have no idea if this is the complete version of this work."
1714,4,we are Witnesess,"The book I read was we are Witnesses by Jacob Bias. The book is about five teenagers who lived and died in the Holocaust. I liked this book because I interacted with how kids my age as Jews had to deal with the Holocaust. The teens in this book had to hide and live there lives as people in attics or camps. They were driven out of their homes most belongings left behind. Some of their family were taken away like there dad or mom. Even in hiding some were robbed, not only the families in this book went through this but all the Jews who lived around Europe during the holocaust. Some Jews survived the holocaust but millions of Jews died and in this story you read about how these teens had to deal with it."
1715,1,all cracked up,"Freezer mug worked great for about 2 months - then it cracked and leaked all over freezer - lost my receipt and didn't know how to return - just found how to return, so have to pay shipping and can't get full refund...sad :("
1716,4,Excellent Translation!,"If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent."
1717,3,Not as it appears,"The cover didn't say ""New American Standard Bible""; it said ""Holy Bible"" and the cover is made out of awful, stiff cardboard stuff that is made to look like leather. This was $10 and I'd hoped for a better cover. The inside is fine. I was just disappointed with the cover."
1718,4,Was he?,"The story of the dead man who was given a fictitious identity and was floated ashore in Spain in 1943 with papers intended to convince the Germans that the southern attack on Europe would be through Greece instead of Sicily, where it in fact took place. The film is quite entertaining if you take into consideration the inclusion of a fictitious German agent, added because, when the film was made, the fact that the allies had broken the German Enigma codes was not public information. The film had to give some explanation as to how the allies knew that the Germans swallowed the deception and relocated their defences away from Sicily. A fuller and more up to date account is in ""Operation Mincemeat"" which has the benefit of 60 years of additional research."
1719,5,High tension drama !,"""The man who never was"" is truly, one of the most dramatic and smart plans of espionage during the WW2. based on a real fact, the British Intelligence Service pull the wool over the Nazi officials around the fake invasion plans found in a corpse dressed of British soldier. Intriguing and hair-raising all the way through. Directed by Ronald Neame (Tunes of glory), one of the most prominent British directors of his generation.This film -like the good wine- improves through the years."
1720,1,Awful Service,Worst magazine EVER!! I paid for a subscription for my boyfriend and he only received 2 issues!!!
1721,5,Catches teens attention,I work with teens in detention facilities. They love the Degrees of Guilt series! It touches their world. I highly reccommed it for any teenager. This book is my favorite of the three. It touches what it feels like to not fit in and to have your life a mess. It also shows how easily you can fall into wrong choices that lead to severe consequences.I think any teen would like it and relate to it. I liked it myself as an adult. It is very true to the teen world.
1722,1,PURE JUNK,"SO CHEAP AND POORLY MADE THAT WHEN YOU USE THE ITEM IT CUTS YOUR FINGER, EVERY SINGLE TIME"
1723,4,"excellent, comprehensive book",This book effectively addresses the continuum of sexually distructive behaviors and all the spiritual depravity in all of our hearts. The chapter on restoring your marriage is particularly helpful.
1724,2,Meh.,"Nearly every single piece of art in this entire book is from XBOX or XBOX 360. Plus, most of the art really isn't all that good. As the other 2-star reviewer said, where's Frogger? Where's Zelda? More importantly, where are the Gamecube games with great graphics? Twilight Princess & Super Mario Sunshine had amazing graphics. I do not recommend this to any non-XBOX fanboys."
1725,2,Looks Good but Step-by-Step Diagrams are not Provided,"I have an eight year old that loves Mindstorms and needs the step-by-step instructions that Lego generally provides. Looks great for older kids.Also, its NOT NXT."
1726,5,Good To Go,"This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album."
1727,3,The last one was better but still worth 12 bucks!!!!,"This was another good enough outing for Tego but he could do much better. The guy is too good to just have okay albums they should all be instant classics and this one just isn't his break out cd ""El Abayarde"" was testament to his nastiness on the Mic. The last Cd had its moments this one does to but they just aren't as bright."
1728,5,Disturb not the dream,I have read and re-read this book and I enjoyed it.I thought it would make an interesting movie.It was a good mix of good and evil combined.
1729,5,Word biblical commentary vol. 1 Genesis 1-15,"Im just getting into this commentary and so far so good,excellent material, very technical and informative. I highly recommend it."
1730,3,Just ok,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I can't say I was impressed. There are some funny moments and some cute dialog between the two cousins, but overall, it was a somewhat boring read. The story got old quick and I had a hard time paying attention to what was going on, or even caring for that matter. The one plus is it is a nice book for someone who would prefer not to slog through a lot of useless, gratuitous sex and vulgar language. I guess to be fair, I need to try another of this series before I judge too harshly. If you are looking for a fast paced, exciting, sit on the edge of your seat mystery, this is not the one"
1731,3,Ummmm.....,"I must say after hearing this CD that I'm a little disappointed. Not in Stacie- she's obviously talented. It's just that the songs seem so wrapped up in the production that poor Stacie gets lost sometimes. Can she sing? I think so, but unlike the Rachael Lampa CD, you never really get a chance to find out. I think somewhere in there, a great singer is dying to get out. Next time, let her sing!"
1732,4,Great Cd!,"This CD is great! I heard one song off of it and then I just had to pick one up. I'm a young person so I'm into the strong beats, and R&B grooves that Stacie does so well. But after a while, you are more into the beats, rather than her lyrics. And her lyrics are very good! They reach out to her generation. So if you are going to buy this CD, don't hesitate to stop and listen to the lyrics!"
1733,5,*Very Good Debut CD!*,"I really liked this CD! If you're into her type of music you'll love it! I really like all her songs, except for ""O O Baby"" which kind of got on my nerves. But other than that, this CD is well worth the money!"
1734,5,coinera,Love her music. My daughter loved the cd. Everything was great. Satcie Orico is extremely talented and sings Christian music that will uplift you. Very contemporary.
1735,3,Defect,"I really liked the size and the font but the pages were coming off the binding. Also, the snap was too difficult and I think using it would cause the binding to separate. I returned it but would have loved it except that one main issue."
1736,3,Good read,"Putting the typos aside, it was a pretty good read. Didn't love it....but it was decent. His style is a bit terse."
1737,5,Bradley is the best Smoker.,"Bradley pucks are hands above any other smoker. The key is their concentrated bisquettes which have concentrated flavor with no adulterants and you control the time (20 minutes per puck). If you are considering a smoker, these are the woods to get. Maple is a great mild flavor."
1738,5,great product,As advertsed. Good product. all of the bradlet biscuitts are great. have used nearly all flavors and get good results.johnny
1739,5,Ry's own voice................................,"A bit of a ""return to his own roots"" effort in that Ry:(a) sings in a style I remember him most for, that is, in a straightforward unstrained manner, as he did on his great earlier albums, and(b) brings back to his arena some political folk sentiments, some Woody Guthrie/Pete Seeger style sprinklings along the way.And he also brings along something rather new for him, a concept album built along a developing lyrical theme. So we have a story line that runs the length of the album.As always, excellent sidemen and women bring invaluable contributions. But my first thought on hearing this was that Ry was letting his own voice take its rightful place in the mix again, while still allowing room for the guests and (of course) his own string playing."
1740,4,everthing old is new again,"The music is superb. The lyrics/stories contained are not nostalgic, per se, but rather a reminder of a time when social consciousness was admirable and brave. This ranks with Cooder's best. As with Chavez Ravine, it's not for everyone, but for most folks who enjoy musical craftsmanship and also having their intellects tweaked a little, remembering the past and reframing their concept of the present, it's sheer pleasure. Better luck next time, Nick."
1741,3,Almost a classic but a few flaws.,"Ok here I go.I'm not going to ramble,babble or nit pick.I enjoyed listening to this album.Its a story about a cat,a mouse,and a toad who takes a journey through various life experience of yesterday.Its a clever well thought up album from Ry with all the great lyrics and colorfull characters.The opening track Suitcase In Hand is a poppy tune and stays with you throughout the even tiresome track of Green Dog and the yawnfull track of The Dying Truck Driver.He wraps the album up with a pleasant track called There's A Bright Side Somewhere but its too short.This album is worth getting and he uses great people to colaberate with such as Jim Keltner,Mike Seeger,Pete Seeger,Joachim Cooder and others.Its folky,bluesy and enjoyable just skip over the boring tracks."
1742,2,Buddy,"I hate to say it,but for the 1st time ever I am severely disappointed in something connected with Ry Cooder.Musically,it sounds like so much hillbilly and not at all what I have come to expect from an artist whom I have admired for decades.I bought the album unheard,purely on past experiences,but sadly did not enjoy it at all."
1743,5,A DARK DYNAMIC DOWNHOME DUSTBOWL DIAMOND,"Music and politics don't mix, just like church and state don't mix. Lighten up Nick, this is music, not a political attack. I love the concept of this album, although I haven't heard it yet, like Nick, but I will someday real soon.To other readers disturbed by Nick's review - check out his other reviews, he doesn't favor too many things. And the stuff he does like, pop band Pilot - now there's a band on the cutting edge that I'm going to rush out and buy! I actually have a Pilot vinyl recording from long ago, I didn't know they ranked to be put on CD.As of March 14, I have listened to this disc - and it is very good. One of Mr. Cooders best. Dense, deep, diversified, devilish, didactic, and dedicated to the working man, the downtrodden, the disillusioned, the disenfranchised - stuck on ""d"" words today. Anyhow, any recording with this much of Mike Seeger contributing has got to be one thing - DeLuxe!"
1744,5,Did I Hear You Say Ry Cooder Album Is About a Cat; as In Kitty Cat?,"Ry Cooder's latest album is an folk music opera to a rambling cat named Buddy who sleeps in a little suitcase and hobos around America with his best friend, a pro-labor union mouse named Lefty.Huh?...come again? No, Ry Cooder has not lost his mind. Let me assure all doubters that ""My Name Is Buddy"" is not only his most audacious recording to date but arguably his best.Knowing what you do about Ry Cooder's impeccable musical reputation do you think he'd risk it all to write a bizarre roots music epic about about a working class hobo cat? Don't think too long about the question because the entire idea seems so laughably absurd. It is not our place to question artistic genius.In reality Cooder's musical statement tells us more about human relations than animal behavior. I can only tell you that you're missing something very special if you can't suspend disbelief and listen to this album on Ry Cooder's own artistic terms."
1745,3,Good--but it doesn't hold together for me as well as the reviews described,"I got the CD because I like Ry Cooder and like the concept of a story-CD. For me, ""Chavez Ravine"" felt like a more cohesive body of material, though.I cannot fault the musicianship and the storyline is fascinating. Anyone who has a past anchored in the Dust Bowl area will identify with the stories---Cooder must have done his research from testimonials of folks who'd been there. If you are interested in this topic, the Oklahoma Historical Society has an extensive oral history collection, plus there were many interviews conducted by the WPA during the Depression. (The Indian Pioneer Histories)One thing, I'm happy I got this CD used. I'd probably rate it less if I'd paid $16.99 for it and seen the 'eco packaging' already raveling at the edges. Yes, I'd like friendlier CD covers, but please can we at least get archival quality here? I do plan on keeping this CD."
1746,3,SINGLES,"ITS ABOUT TIME VICKY LEANDROS PUT OUT AN ALBUM IN ENGLISH,SHE RECORDED MANY SONGS IN ENGLISH AND THESE SHOULD BE ON A CD,WAY OVERDUE FOR HER,NANA MOUSKOURI RECORDED IN ENGLISH WHY NOT VICKY"
1747,4,Great product,"This is a very good product. I begin use this evening creme, about a month ago and i can already see some subtle improvements on my skin."
1748,5,Beautiful Goodbye,"This is a beautiful goodbye to a world famous artist. This is Celia's party and it's a good one! Like some of the producers say of this production 'We wanted REAL reactions, not fake ones'. All of the artists were REAL in their goodbyes. Miami had a special light that night. Los Trio, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Gloria Estafan with Patti LaBelle, Don Pedro Knight--the performances were outstanding."
1749,2,Regret Purchase,It felt very sad to me as Celia just sat there. I expected more based on the reviews and I was very disappointed.
1750,2,Wasn't what I wanted,"This product is for turning a petcock valve, not for removing/installing a drain plug. It's my fault for not reading the description clearly, but what I wanted was a tool for removing the drain plug on my Atwood 6 gal water heater in my travel trailer. The nylon plug is in an awkward location and without a long socket extension (which I dont' have) it is a pain to screw and unscrew. Even though this plug is only finger-tight."
1751,5,Great,Sooo happy to have found these again. Great product!!! Work just as well as I remembered. Thank you Chore Boy!
1752,5,Wonderful scrubbies!!!!!!!,"I used these along time ago and could not find them anywhere. I then found them at my church when I was cleaning, and had a name to research. I looked on Amazon and there there were, they are great for all types of dishes and pots and pans. Do not scrub too hard on plastic as there will be scarring, but they clean and do not get smelly. Highly recommend.!!!!!"
1753,3,3 stars,"Night In Eden started out strongly. I was intrigued with the Australian setting and sympathized with the hero and heroine. Both had experienced great losses recently and striving to overcome them.The character of Bryony was well-developed and multi-demensional, however, I felt a little cheated in regards to Hayden. I don't think there was enough from his point-of-view for me. I didn't always know what he was feeling or thinking. The author would touch on it, but not elaborate as she did with the heroine.The sexual tension was good, but I was expecting more from the rave reviews. There wasn't much of a build up. It was just all of a sudden ""I want her"". I wasn't ever sure if the hero ever really *loved* her.Overall, this was a good book. The writing style was favorable and the setting was different, but the many tragedies set a pall over it that didn't leave me ""satisfied"".This is my first book by this author and I will try another before giving up."
1754,4,Fine Read,"I would have given this book five stars but I feel it had a really slow start. But after the first few chapters, the sexual tension between the main characters began to heat up. REALLY HEAT UP! I found myself getting into this book and I would recommend reading it. Although you may think it is boring at first, it will seriously grab your attention. Give it a try."
1755,1,It made me gain weight.,"This stuff... sucks. At first, I was all gung-ho about trying it after reading Jillian Michael's book, Making the Cut. It's one of the supplements she recommends for women with an underactive thyroid. I don't have hypothyroidism, but my numbers are low so I figured I might as well give it a whirl. 10 lbs later, I realized I may be taking more than just ""guggul"". My doctor thinks there might have even been some type of steroid-like substance in it, because I gained 10 lbs in a month! I am a healthy eater, and I work out 5-6 days/week because I'm also a personal trainer. The way I see it.. don't waste your money, if you think you have a thyroid problem, go to an endocrinologist and get the real drugs, the ones where you know exactly what's in them."
1756,1,A Waste of a Picture,"This picture is a complete waste, considering it had nothing to offer, even the perversion in the film becomes trite and tiring, by the end, I had hoped that all the characters would wind up dead because they are uninteresting. The director thinks that he is being morally ambiguous by presenting Bardem as a villain who rapes and plunders all form of human decency but actually he is being silly. The film never knows if it is being a slasher film or a comedy, but by the end, who really cares as long as this disaster is over?...."
1757,5,An Outstanding History of Efforts to Learn the Geology of the Moon,"This lengthy and detailed account of lunar exploration and science strikes a balance between personal memoir and history. As history it provides a detailed and contextual account of lunar geology during the 1960s and 1970s, and a less detailed but informative account for the rest of the century. As memoir it provides an engaging story of the scientific exploration of the Moon as seen by one of the field's more important behind-the-scenes scientists who worked on Apollo.This is certainly the most detailed personal account of lunar science during the Apollo program, and should be read in tandem with Donald A. Beattie's ""Taking Science to the Moon: Lunar Experiments and the Apollo Program"" (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001)."
1758,3,3 and 1/2 stars...Major lunar geology discussion...,"Whew!...You almost need to take a geology class before tackling this. Wilhems goes into great detail describing the moon from a geologists standpoint, so be prepared for that, but, the things that I took from this is that he also describes the early history of the un-manned program of lunar exploration (Ranger and Surveyor programs) in excellent detail as well as the geology history of the manned program, training and all. Obviously, the later (Apollo 15 through 17) missions are covered in more detail than the early ones, but there is something here for everyone interested in the Apollo program...just be prepared to be inundated with geology-speak."
1759,2,"This was not one of her best books, yet not a failure.","This book is really exciting;from the first chapter only. I am going to be honest with you, because if I raved about how wonderful and exciting this book was, it would be a lie. It was written with appropreate remarks and English grammer, but sometimes storys just don't get you in the heart. This perticular one didn't. But there are her other books, which I would say, are a masterpiece!"
1760,4,One of the Best,"I am a big fan of Ann Rinaldi, and I definatly think this is one of her best. It is a great book to curl up with, and once you start reading, it's hard to stop. Is is about a young girl who is confused and frightened after the assination of Abraham Lincoln. The story is very intriguing and, as with most of her books, a small and not overdone love story is taking place between two of the characters. It is worth reading, whether you buy it or not."
1761,2,Dark is right!,"A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books."
1762,3,Same exact product other vendors are sourcing from china,"Look around for the best price. I have ordered these from Amazon Vendors and from brick and mortar. Exactly the same item. Same exact ""made in China"" label in the same spot. Product does what it is needed to replace screws and pads lost on glasses."
1763,4,Fast. Easy. Online.,"What's more to say about a product that works? I ordered two for my tenants so they can use the wireless network instead of running ethernet cable all around the house. Both were older machines running Windows XP. Installation was a breeze and both computers were online on within 10 minutes. Modem/router located in a downstairs bedroom. Upstairs computer gets a strong signal and the downstairs computer gets a stronger signal with speeds that rival a computer hard lined to the router. If there was one thing I could change about this product, it would be the pigtail on the antennae. There's barely enough slack for the antennae to sit on top of the tower. Good product."
1764,4,Packet-Tastic,"This card is the fastest and most reliable wireless device that I have ever purchased. The reception is always 3 to 4 bars, even from across the house. My newer PC is mostly MSI components and contains a similar card as this model, so I knew this was the right choice."
1765,5,Wireless delight,"After reading the reviews on this item, I still ordered it with some fear and trepidation, planning on tapping my knowledgable son-in-law to bail me out. Not needed at all. Opened the box, plugged it in, hooked up the antenna and Windows XP did the rest. Connected within minutes of booting up the computer. It is working just fine and I am very pleased."
1766,4,Works great,This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.
1767,5,Works As Advertised,"After reading the one star reviews, I am not convinced those reviewers reviewed the same product. I installed this wireless card in a Dell Optiplex GX280 and then installed Windows 7 RRM x86 (fresh installation). Windows 7 had a driver, loaded it, and that is it - connected to my Linksys wireless router at 54mbs. Very surprised that Vista users would have driver issues..."
1768,1,Una porqueria no compre,"Total porqueria de repente dejo de conectarse, veo todas las redes pero no puede conectarse. lo barato sale caro"
1769,1,DO NOT BUY!,1) Too many options to make it run smoothly.2) Not a plug & play3) Breaks connection haphazardly
1770,2,Keeps dropping the connection.,"I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon."
1771,5,Breathe New Life Into Your Aging Desktop,"I was almost getting ready to ditch my Aging Dell Dimension XPS B1000r Desktop until I read a review of this this Wireless PCI Card. It is inexpensive and installation was a breeze. I installed the included software, input my AT&T ""2Wire Wireless Gateway"" WEP Key, rebooted the system and I was surfing the internet wirelessly in no time. Signal strength has been consistently rated excellent at 54.0 Mbps speed. My PC runs on Windows XP Pro. I downloaded the ""Ralink WMP-Rt2561ST"" driver as suggested by some reviewers but never installed it as my system is working just fine with driver bundled in the included CD. I found the length of the antenna cord more than adequate. I just sat the antenna on top of my desktop inside my PC cabinet: smart design."
1772,2,Plus-Minus Chart Toy,"Big problem... the answers are not printed on the key above. They are underneath the key, so that when you depress it, you can see through. The problem is the numbers on top are over the number underneath in many cases, which makes the answer harder to see. I really prefer the ones where you can clearly see the answer print above."
1773,1,Useless,"I was so excited to receive this to help my 5 year old with her addition and subtraction. You are supposed to press on the button and ""magically"" the correct answer appears.No magic here! The answers are simply underneath and as you push, the correct answers underneath are supposed to become more transparent or visible (similar to using tracing paper and placing it over something you want to trace. The closer the tracing paper is to the image you want to copy, the more clearly you can see it.) Well, neither my daughter nor I could even make out what the answers were. How are we supposed to read THROUGH a plastic button? It made no sense.This was really a disappointment and such a waste!"
1774,2,Average Book,The book wasn't as great as the reviews said it was. The explanation on many of the topics was sketchy and didn't have the detail I expected (e.g. AWT). It's probably a better book if you already know Java and are looking to catch some of the finer points. I don't recommend it for absolute beginners.
1775,2,A good source of propaganda!,"I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"
1776,3,Good Textbook - but good examples are missing,"O.K. The text covers the Java stuff you need to know. It has a clear structure and is definitely a very good textbook. But if you try to learn Java or try to make the transition from a non object-oriented langauge using this book - you'll miss some examples. Peter v.d. Linden would be better off sharing his programming experience by providing examples for the subjects he covers. Instead of giving a simple ""hello world"" program in the first chapter, he comes with a full blown, four color, text-scrolling, window based ""hello world"". Who the hell is supposed to understand the code when he or she never saw object-oriented code? But don't get me wrong - it is definitely a good textbook!"
1777,3,For intermediate programmers only.,This book is far too basic for experienced programmers and probably too advanced for people who are just beginning to program.
1778,2,Not for true beginners,"I bought this book after reading the reviews. The impression I had was that this would be an excellent introduction to Java. What I discovered is that this book ASSUMES KNOWLEDGE OF C++. If you dont have some background in C++, then skip this and go for something else!"
1779,1,Please dont buy if you are entirely new to Java Concepts,"Firstly,Amazon's own review about this book - ""If you want to learn Java FROM ZERO..."" is entirely misleading. The author has written this book as if he is talking to his collegues(who obviously know Java) over the coffee table. If you want to learn Java from Zero , are new to programming concepts,OOPS etc. just stay as far as possible from this book and PLEASE dont go by the 4 and 5 stars this books has.THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS and I STRONGLY REQUEST AMAZON to remove their recommentdation about this book for beginners.I have returned this book and am pretty comfortable with the following two books Thinking in Java and Beginning Java2.0 Please trust me and dont waste your time and energy and money on any other books to learn Java."
1780,3,More fun than truly helpful.,This wedding guide shares lots of intersting trivia and information about the history of brides and nuptual celebrations. The actual advice is a little dated and not particularly unique from what you might find in other guides.
1781,4,The end of an arc and some weirdness,"This series brings the end of the Alabasta ark and is a great finale...however, there are filler episodes at the end which some One Piece fans may not enjoy as much as others. Up to you if you watch them though as they are at the end, not in the middle, which is a nice way to lay them out."
1782,4,The Hound From Hell plays well on Kindle,"I have the Kindle software on several of my computers, but this is the first volume that I read on my new Kindle Fire. It was a good choice. I'm not certain how many times I have read “The Hounds of the Baskervilles,“ but it is more than a couple, and this was as pleasurable as any. The price was right too. So, if you like Holmes, this is great read."
1783,1,The Hound of the Baskervilles,"This is a classic mystery by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, this free version lacks several sections vital to solving the mystery. I have only read a couple chapters and have already found that the legend of the Baskervilles, the account of the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a letter to Sir Henry Baskerville are missing. These omissions render this version useless, and force me to delete it from my library."
1784,3,not a classic I would recommend,"I am a consistent nonfiction book reader - as long as I can remember.But I have a hard time with this book & lost interest. I followed the classic thru to the end, but it is not a book that I would recommend to another."
1785,1,Nothing superb about Holmes.,"""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the first (and now only) Sherlock Holmes book I have read (only because my book club chose it) and I was beyond bored with it. Nothing was mysterious or suspenseful about it. It was full of babble and slow adventures. Sherlock Holmes was hardly even in it, since Dr. Watson was the narrator and main experiencer of events. Very overrated in my book. I do not recommend."
1786,4,This book is great!,"This is really good book I reccomend it: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson wait inside. It is late around 11:10 p.m. when they see a flash a light through the window. Then they hear a harsh mean howl at the lights apperance. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson duck down and be really quiet. Then they see the light again, but this time no howl. Then the light flashes again this time more like a flash light, light and sherlock knows it. He says , "" My dear Watson I think somebody is out there sending signals to us by light flashes""! Sherlock knows it for sure and then that day they hear that an exscaped prisoner is on the look and he is realted to the Baskervilles!"
1787,1,Missing Passages,"Note: this is a review is specific for theThe Hound of the Baskervillesedition and not the book as a whole. The free kindle edition is missing any passage that would be considered source material in the book. If the character reads from a document, a newspaper, etc... it's just gone. Very disappointing. Don't bother with this version."
1788,1,Passages missing,"This version is missing certain passages, as with other Kindle editions of Sherlock Holmes books. Any time something is read in the story, such as from a newspaper or a letter, it is missing. There are also illustrations found in the original that are missing. As a substitute, I downloaded the Google version of the book on my phone, the picked back up on the Kindle. This makes me hesitant to ever purchase Kindle editions for fear of the same issues."
1789,4,"Doyle, The Hound of The Baskervilles","The Hound of the Baskervilles is a book that I really can't criticize at all with any real power behind it. I really enjoyed this book. I started out with several short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes, found them fascinating, and read this. I wasn't disappointed. The book is rather short so it kind of still keeps that short story feel. It also has the horrid skill of making the reader almost sick with the unknown. When I read this, I wanted it to end more than most other books I've read just to find out what was going on. Also, as a horror fan, I can definitely say that this book has horror elements in it. Some scenes are damn creepy and all scenes are completely necessary with no slow or dull moments to let you lose that building tention. Brilliantly told and a book that is a classic to me. And, in the end, there is always an explanation to satisfy the reader and this is a good one indeed."
1790,4,Hounds of Baskerville,"Required reading for school, not much reason other than i had to buy it. The vendor was great. A great way to save money."
1791,1,MISSING TEXT!!!!!!,"This review is NOT on the quality of the story. I love this book, however.... This edition is missing text. Whenever character reads out of a newspaper or other document, the entire txt of that newspaper or document is missing from this Kindle edition! I've no idea which version to spend the dollar on to get the complete text, but its frustating as this was my first download."
1792,3,The Hound of the Baskervilles,The baskervilles has an interesting history and when Sir Charles Baskerville the 1 of the last living or was 1 of the last living decendents of the Baskervilles is found dead on the grounds of Baskerville Hall The legend of the hellhound hounts the moor is the hellhound real well that is what the greates detective in the world Mr. Sherlock Holmes wants to find out but he Mr.Holmes has to find the legend hellhound before the legend or hellhound finds him.
1793,5,Extremely amazing,All I have to say this album is very worth the money to any die-hard Sailor Moon fan. With songs from all 4 seasons plus a few extras. Of course the stars songs are the best but then again I'm biased cause it is my favorite season. I totally recommend this album to anyone out there looking to listen to the original Japanes scores of music.
1794,3,Buyer Beware,"This cd is protected from being utilized on a computer. If you listen to your cd's on a laptop, or desktop, this is NOT the cd for you. Consider yourself warned."
1795,2,fort apache,The movie is old fashioned and not well acted. It was melodrmatic and artificial.The supplier of the DVD was prompt and professional
1796,3,relativly good book,the book reads fast altough its rather small but it gives another point of view it the author talking about onperson who looks at all the person in a thirth person view wich makes it confusing from time to time but its a good book.
1797,1,Instant Immersion English (5 CD-ROM set),5 disks that are related in title only. Very difficult for non-english speaker to set up. Poor graphics. This is not for someone trying to learn English as a foriegn language. I'm here on Amazon to buy something different.
1798,3,"Great Speech Solutions, not much more","I teach ESL and love to use ONE disk from this set, the phonetic training program called ""Speech Solutions"". It is hard to find anywhere else, but it is worth having if you already feel good about most of your English language, and only need to work on the sounds you are making. It uses a simple, self-guided tour through all the phonemes, or sounds, of the American English language, including consonant pairs and ""r-controlled"" vowels.As far as the other disks are concerned, they might be fun for a novice reader who already speaks English, but they are useless as an ESL tool.Still, I'd buy it over again ust to get the speech program. Not for use with novice ESL students."
1799,5,"Perfect, small stamp set for our toddler's little hands","I purchased this stamp set because I was looking for a small stamp set to use on my toddler's little hand to help reinforce positive behavior (long story, too many child development books!)If you are looking for a small stamp set that is safe and doesn't have harsh chemicals-- this is perfect. Most reviewers who were diappointed indicated that the size was too small. But the description is accurate: this stamp kit is 4 by 6 inches. That should give you an idea of the size of each stamp."
1800,1,Disappointingly tiny,"I had bought a different Melissa and Doug stamp set that was an acceptable size, and assumed this would be similar. But this one is really too tiny. I couldn't tell from Amazon's picture just how small it was! There may have been an indication of the dimensions in the product description, but I missed it. Perhaps Amazon needs to be more clear about these things."
1801,5,Awesome!,"Bought this for my 6 yr old who is currently obsessed with trains. Have watched it many, many times now! Very interesting for adults also. Highly recommend this for any youngster who loves trains. I also recommend I Love Big Trains part 1 & 2."
1802,4,A Reader from Baltimore Maryland,"This is a pretty good book. The main focus is on the struggle of the Navajo people against the United States government. Tiana Bighorse's stories about her father that he told her make up this book's chapters. The stories are interesting and do a good job explaining the Navajo plight. The stories include fighting, running away, terrible atrocities commited by our government, and the struggle of her father and other warriors. On the whole the book is interesting and informative."
1803,3,Sticky,"It is definitely quenching my skin's thirst, but makes my legs kind of sticky. I'm wearing a skirt today and my legs just keep sticking together, I feel like I have to peel them apart, and this is nine hours after applying it. I felt as though the glowing white of my skin was already gone after applying it just once. It left just a touch of color, which is what it claims to do."
1804,3,"For the price, this has alot to offer","There is alot missing from this program (and most German programs out there, in my opinion), but it has some nice features. The games are just flashcard practice, but fun nonetheless. The speech recognition on CD 3 is not as good as German Now! 9, but still helpful. The picture dictionary isn't terribly helpful.The game on CD 5, Who is Oscar Lake, was what really made me want to get this. The concept is great, and after learning the interface and giving it time, it grew on me.Having fun and maintaining your interest in the language is the best way to learn it. That is a strength of this program, in my opinion. I would recommend using this program as a supplement to a class, textbook, or mabye a better program, because it is not comprehensive enough to stand alone. But for a good price, why not go for it?"
1805,2,Poor Quality,The Book is old and discolored and is not the book you advertised when I see a product that is what I expect. The copy in the picture is what I expected. And this book is not new. The one in the picture is the collector edition. I did not want just any copy.
1806,3,Decent book quality,"The product was delivered on time. Good price. However, it was damaged in two places and it was suppose to be new. That being said it was not bad enough to go through the hassle of returning and getting a new one! Slightly disappointed in the quality!!"
1807,4,Still a Classic After All These Years,"Well worth the short time it takes to read it. Had heard of this book all my life, but had never read it. Now I know what I was missing. Not that there is anything new here in terms of faith or theology--there's not. But the manner in which this story is told is entertaining and captivating, still, after all these years. Truths we have been taught and learned through our life's experience are here, all told in a most entertaining and enlightening way. It makes one smile, laugh and, at times, touches one's heart. If it is your first time to read it or your first time in a long time, it's well worth the read. Well worth it. We're all pilgrims and we are all traveling through a foreign land..."
1808,4,Wonderful allegory of the Christian life.,"""The Pilgrim's Progress"" is widely known and widely imitated. Perhaps a bit too widely. While the book itself is stunning, having seen, heard, or read so many attempts to imitate it, I found that the original effect of the story was lessened for me.By all means, this book should be read -- it is in itself a great work of literature, and it is a prime example of Puritan thought. Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story! I shall be re-reading this in the not-too-distant future, hopefully better prepared to dismiss the memories of the imitations and to appreciate the genius of Bunyan's allegory.Read it!"
1809,5,A Story For Everybody,"This book stands alone as one of the most powerful and easily read books of all time. Bunyan's simple style makes every point clear and without the possibility for misinterpretation. A tale of life and its trials, this book should be read by all."
1810,4,Good quality,"Seems like a good quality vitamin, but my dog didn't like them too much. He ate them, but not enthusiastically."
1811,2,Not as good as the other album!,"I was excited to get my Steppin' album because I loved the other album of Christy Baron (I thought about you). However, I was a bit disapointed beacause it was so inferior compared to I thought about you. I was expecting more of Christy Baron's sultry renditions of real accoustic jazz but what I got was some sort of a synthesized versions. It's still a good album but it's nothing like the other one. If you can only buy one album of Christy Baron, don't get this one."
1812,2,Emma as a deer in headlights!,"While this version of Emma is probably the most faithful to the book, the Emma we get is a woman whose face is frozen in what seems to be a perpetual startled stare. What a distraction every time she was on screen. And Harriet Smith was a cowering country bumpkin who was simpering and cloyingly annoying...ugh! It is only because the rest of the cast was so good that I give this version of Emma 2 stars.If you want to see an Emma worth watching, buy the Gwynneth Paltrow or Kate Beckinsale version."
1813,2,"""O Brother"" Fans Beware!","Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."
1814,1,Makes it's point but pathetic (no pun intended) photography,"Coffee table book of girls at weight-loss camp, exotic dancers in Las Vegas, actresses, children play-acting withmakeup. Not sure if Ms. Greenfield was trying to emulate Cindy Sherman or Diane Arbus. Either way she has my sympathy."
1815,2,Last Tango In Paris,"The video I recently purchased was NOT the original version. The Hayes Commission version is edited for content to the point the film loses it's provocative edge, with out which is disjointed (pun intended) and boring. I've looked elsewhere for the original release version which at the time was X rated, but now all I see is the ""R"" rating which means all the good scenes are cut out!But I'll Keep looking. It's a real hot classic in it's original formRapscallion"
1816,1,Last Tango in Paris,Poor content. Had to read what was going on by reading the screen as most of it was in another language.
1817,2,One long WTF? moment.,"We watched Last Tango in Paris mainly just to say we've seen it. Little did we realize how messed up most of the characters are & how disturbing a few scenes would be...however, it is french directed so I guess that explains it (a genre neither my wife or I have ever been able to embrace). Did not care for the film at all but give it 2 stars for the shockingly hairy full frontal."
1818,1,"Boring, Senseless, Waste of Time","Don't waste your time. If you are watching it to see the controversial steamy sex scenes, you'll be disappointed. There is nothing erotic here. It's a film devoid of emotion or excitement. It's mind-numbing and boring. It may have been praised at the time it was first released, but it has not aged well. Surprising that it was ever determined to be a film with any value even when first released. Pointless film with characters that don't seem to have any direction in their lives and don't seem to care about anything important. The viewer doesn't care either. Glad I saw this free, as I would hate to have paid even $1 to watch it. Your life will be better for NOT having seen this movie."
1819,2,Extremely disappointing,"This movie fails horribly at living up to its reviews. They seem to be based solely on technical merit; it is indeed shot well. Unfortunately, that does not make it worth watching; the plot is lacking, the sex alternates between disappointing and disturbing, and the characters are despicable. Don't waste your time."
1820,5,"Last Tango, Great Film",Last Tango in Paris is truly one of the greatest films of the 1970s. Marlon Brando gives a very powerful performance as Paul the middle aged widower who has a sexual liason with a chance encounter. A fascinating motion picture to say the least.
1821,1,dawn on a distant shore,"Very disapointing. I loved Into the Wilderness and could not wait for DDS, signing up for delivery before it came out in print. I found it difficult to get into and just didn't keep my attention. I actually had to force myself to sit down and finish it. Sadly, DDS lacked the excitement and sexual tensions of Into the Wilderness. Definately not Sara Donati's best work."
1822,5,Waterproof!!,"Just used this tent for the first time this weekend. My husband and I camped for 3 nights in Vermont, 2 of those nights it rained. No water inside the tent at all!! We have never had this experience before!! We did not use any waterproofing spray or seam sealer, but we did use a tarp underneath. Don't waste your time with the plastic provided stakes, buy good ones. There is plenty of room for 2 people in this tent with a queen air mattress, although I think 2 twins on opposite sides of the tent would offer the best use of space. Wonderful tent, easy, quick set-up. Love this tent!!"
1823,3,Recently purchased,"I bought this tent and used it for the first time recently. Good points: The tent is HUGE. I am 5'9"" and could stand all the way up in the tent. The gear loft is nice and there are lots of storage pockets inside. Bad Points: Tent Poles are outragously heavy. This is definately not a tent you would want to carry very far. There are a few seams at ground level, one right in the middle of the floor. It rained the first night we set up and some moisture came in from the bottom of the tent. Luckily we had a footprint on the inside of the tent as well. Overall this is a good buy for the price I paid. I bought the tent for $99, and noticed the price is now $179. I don't think I would pay that much for this tent."
1824,1,A Claustrophobic Mess,"Bland characters, murky filming and gratuitous gore make for a horror movie mess in The Descent. I did not care one bit for the women or their fates. If there's a sequel, count me out."
1825,3,Expected better,"I guess I expected more from the movie because of all the rave reviews about it but in the end my husband and I were left feeling disappointed. The beginning was long and drawn out which began to bore, the female cast could not have been made up of more annoying actors (we were so ready for them to start dying)and I just could not understand WHY they did not realize they were at the wrong cave to begin with!!! Obviously the one the egotistical Juno led them to was not accesable, nor was it meant for, non-professional cave explorers! I guess its meant to show what can happen if you just blindly trust someone. I gave it 3 stars because the creatures were very effective at what they do and were very menacing to look at, also I liked the fact that they were blind but still lethal. I really wanted to like this movie alot and was loooking forward to watching it but ended up feeling let down."
1826,2,Boring movie with good Blu-ray features,"THE DESCENT is an ugly, boring film about six ugly, boring women with a curious mix of accents who explore a cave and are stalked and eaten by a group of Gollum wannabes. The film looks ugly and boring on Blu-ray with over staurated colors and high contrast levels. Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in ""behind the scenes"" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film. Loads of extra and extended scenes, interviews etc. do nothing to alleviate all the ugly boredom this film invokes. I bought it for ten bucks at Wal-mart and I guess it was worth that for the cool features on the Blu-ray but I sure feel ugly and bored after watching it all."
1827,1,ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FOR THE WRONG FILM!!!,"Note that all of the reviews posted here are for a completely different movie ""Descent"", NOT the horror movie ""The Descent"". Please check what movie you are posting for before you post a review!"
1828,2,horror for ten year olds,"Half a dozen women go down to explore an unexplored cave--without weapons to defend themselves with(should danger arise--and arise it does.) Right there the filmmaker lost all credibility with me, and not only that, you could hardly see/make out what the hell was going on with anyone; they made the cave that damn dark.I paid more than seventeen bucks for the DVD, tried to return it, unsuccessfully (Target won't accept returns, unless it is for the exact same thing) so ended up giving it to a friend. I don't keep DVDs I have no respect for in my collection.This was not well written, either, and don't believe this film director gets the horror genre at all.I suppose I'll be waiting for the next Alex Aja flick. Now here's someone who UNDERSTANDS what horror is about."
1829,4,good movie,"I'm not much for words when it comes to writing reviews, but I thought this was a good movie if you like scarey movies."
1830,4,Stay Far Away from Caves,Very suspenseful and scary gem of a horror movie. The tension just keeps growing until you can't take it anymore. The creatures are simple but effective especially in the right light. Can't wait to see what the director does next. Ignore the awful sequel.
1831,4,Good movie,I loved the coming attractions more than the flick but it is still good epescially if you like the this type of flick. I think if they didn't show the creatures so much it would have been a little more scarier. Either way it seems very original at least midway through the end. I own it and have watched it a few times. It definitley has replay value. Watch it in the dark.
1832,2,over rated,had been given such a write up on this - disappointing to say the least. No shocks - highly predictable - and with a theme that has been done to death!!
1833,3,Not BAD,"not as bad as I thought it was going to be. not really scary or anythingbut it was interesting . its too bad they didnt do more with this movie ,it could have been so much better."
1834,3,Predictable But Still Entertaining,"This movie started off slow at first but started to pick up once the group of women descended further into the cave. What happened while they were down there was predictable, but still entertaining nonetheless. The best part of the movie was when two of the women were battling it out with those slimy human-like creatures, whose presence bewildered me. I saw slimy human-like men and women, but no offspring? Wouldn't they want to eat human flesh too? Then there was the pool of blood. How in the world did it get there? The ending wasn't as ""happy"" as I expected to be, which was somewhat of a surprise. Overall, ""The Descent"" is still a good movie to watch, but ""The Cave"" is better."
1835,4,I'm gonna sleep now... wait! What just happened?!,"This movie had no point of showing a car accident and some pipes went through a girl's head. And the beginning and the first half of the middle was all thrill and boring. When you first see the crawlers, you would think it's been like 2 hours of the movie. But I would give you all anadvice, don't watch horror movies in really sunny, bright day time! It's not because it wouldn't be scary then, horror movies alway take place in a dark place and if you hear screaming or someone getting killed, you're gonna wonder how or what just happened! 'Cause that's what happened to me wile watching this. And how can those crawlers be real cavemen that are cannibals? There were no cavemen in America! There is no way that those crawlers could be people that just mutated and wanting eat any living things. This movie did have hardcore killings! I would give you another advice and not buy the DVD but just rent it. I can't wait for Descent 2 this year!"
1836,1,Blows!!!,"As I write this I'm 48 min. into the movie and i don't know if I'm watching a female version of cliffhanger or a Horror movie. All I have seen is 5 females have a sleepover in a cabin, some woman get stuck and starts to hyperventelate and some woman have a hard to time crossing over a hole. So if your up for watching 5 women having a caving expedition with the usual female driven bickering among each other then i would recommend it but if your looking for horror see Wolf Creek or something. Oh by the way i'm 56 min. into it now and still nothing. Save your money."
1837,3,Happy to find my favorite discontinued lipstick but...,"I loved the Stila Nicole color and as usual when I find a lipstick I love it always seems to be discontinued.I was so happy to find the lipstick and I ordered 3.they arrived less than a week later but to my surprise...it smelled and tasted a bit rancid....I think they have been around to long....oh well, I learned my lesson."
1838,3,VERY SEXY,"My husband thought this was great. Being 5'2"" I found it to be just nice. Like I said my hunny loved it. He didn't notice that since it was made for taller women the legs were slightly baggy on me(men!). If your short and don't intend to wear it out of the bedroom then It does the job. I wouldn't recomend wearing it under a dress though for the above reason no matter how much he begs."
1839,5,MAGIC is FUN...WE'RE DEAD,"I've been waiting for a decent DVD ""print"" of this movie for years. This is really a find. The transfer is amazing and the special features are well worth the ticket price.The disc even includes the famous TV commercial that scared so many kids the networks had it pulled. 'Didn't matter. If you saw it once, it stuck in your head....""Magic is fun....We're Dead!""The soundtrack is MONO but that's the way it was released in the theaters and it sounds really rich.I'm giving this one 5 stars for good reasons."
1840,1,More Ham-O-Rama Theatrics From Sir Anthony,"Whenever anyone I know blathers on about how great an actor Sir Anthony Hopkins is, I tell them to stick this in the VCR. It's a horror movie, alright: a horror to sit through. lt's Battle of the Uncured Hams as Sir Anthony, Ann-Margret and Burgess Meredith act up a storm on a script that should have never seen the light of day. Fats the Dummy is unquestionably the best actor in this movie but regrettably has to share scenes with the aforementioned actors; if only Fats had been able to break away from Sir Anthony's arm earlier in the movie and massacred the entire cast, I'd be writing a five-star rating instead of this. If you need convincing that Hopkins' success in ""Silence of the Lambs"" was just a fluke and that he is indeed just another tough slice of fatty Welsh ham, watch a double feature of this and ""Legends of the Fall""; Hopkins is like some Monty Python grotesque played for pathos instead of comedy."
1841,4,Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins,"My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it."
1842,3,"Excellent movie, terrible tape quality and editing","I have loved this movie since it was released. I had searched for some time to find it in a rental shop or movie store. I found it here and bought it. The tape quality is terrible, but worse is the awful edit job that was done. This is like a TV version of the original film. The film gets 5 stars, but the tape quality and editing bring the overall rating down to 3."
1843,4,Great value - dump your inkjet and save money per page,"Went out and got one of these from Staples (an Amazon partner ahem) on special for ninety nine bucks. For that, it's a great deal. I use it on my computer running Ubuntu Linux (Dapper Drake 6.02) and it works great. Had to figure out how to use foo2zjs (foo2zjs dot rkkda dot com has the perfect workable answer to installation...I donated a few dollars for the help), but once you follow the instructions and load that all-important firmware, you are in business, even allowing you to set the printer to toner-saver mode, etc.We also use tonerrefillkits dot com extensively and just refill the cartrdige over and over until the head starts wearing. By then we have saved tons of money using a refilled laser printer vs. buying the cartridges or god forbid using a color inkjet (eek expensive).Good stuff, love HP, thanks!"
1844,2,Doesn't Seem to Work with Print Servers,"This printer is inexpensive and fast but does not seem to work with either Linksys (WPS54G) printservers, DLink printservers (DP-G310), or Hawking printservers (HWPS1UG). I went through several phone calls with excellent support people at both Linksys and Hawking Technology to no avail. I upgraded firmware and installation programs but as far as the printservers are concerned the HP does not exist on the network.I have no idea what the problem could be but the HP1020 is not printserver friendly as far as I can tell. It is not as if I am running some obscure printservers either. The printerserver's company's products are well known and stable."
1845,3,HP LaserJet 1020 Printer,"It woorks very well.But when I cancel it because of error, it took forever to cancel.So I can't wait anymore an I turn off and turn on gain.Sometimes I use next printer in other to finish it quickly.This is not convenient compare to other printer."
1846,5,A Great Printer for the Price!,"I have only had the printer for about a month, but I think it's great. The only downside is that the UBS adapter is not included with the printer (You can pick one up at Staples for about $19). You can probably order one at Amazon as well...I just didn't realize I'd need to purchase the adapter when I ordered the printer."
1847,2,"Great printer, unless you're using Vista","I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable."
1848,2,No Driver for the Windows XP Pro x64 Operating System,"The LaserJet 1020 is a fine printer for use with older operating systems. It produces high quality output when attached to my Windows 98SE box. But it doesn't print at all when attached to my new computer with its XP Pro x64 operating system. The problem is there's no compatible driver available, not on HP's LaserJet 1020 installation disk and not on the HP website. I emailed HP Tech Support about the problem and they suggested two workarounds, using x64 drivers for other HP printer models, but neither worked. Tech Support now says to try working the problem via online chat. I'll try that next time I have a block of several hours free, unless I give the printer away first."
1849,3,Curls Quality/Heavy Paper,"Very severely curls papers that are heavy/thick/quality. If you use thick paper this printer will not do, as I have learned the hard way. A review in pcmag or pcworld also states this. very huge drawback.Even if you're just printing it for personal use, sheets get so curled that I have to take time to roll them up the opposite and try to get them flat."
1850,3,"Good movie, bad packaging","This is not a review of the DVD content but more of the physical item itself. I was pretty excited when the package arrived but to my dismay, I heard a rattling sound as I took the DVD out. As I feared, the DVD came off its holder and was bouncing around the whole time during shipment. I immediately looked at the reverse side of the disc and yes, it was scratched pretty badly.To be fair, the DVD was still watch-able but I just sucks to receive a scratched DVD."
1851,4,Make wikis and blogs,"A popular open source Content Management System. Meloni suggests here in her book why it has proved so useful. If you read her book and have some familiarity with Microsoft's Office suite, then you can see what Plone offers. The various Microsoft applications, like MSWord, have very rich toolkits. But each application essentially handles single documents. Meloni shows that Plone's remit is at a higher level of organisation. More to do with workflow between several users.Plus, these users need not be in one physical location. Plone lets a group distributed over the Internet work together. Plone can help enable new types of dispersed ""multinationals"" of just a few people.The book also has merit in showing how to use Plone to construct wikis and blogs. Two topical subjects. And very closely related. So both are described in the same chapter. Daresay that some of you will find this the most useful section of the book."
1852,3,"good, but outdated and unsupported","If you're looking to buy this book now for use with a modern incarnation of Plone, you may want to rethink your decision and look elsewhere. Aside from being written against Plone 2.0 (Plone is currently at version 2.5.1, with 3.0 looming in a few months), and thereby having some tips and instructions that no longer work as originally intended, the book includes some typographical errors (as do many books), a few of which are horrible and misleading. I've actually done everything from inquiring with the publisher regarding errata (you won't find any on the publisher's site for the book) and writing to volunteer the corrections myself (which went unanswered).The book is an excellent introduction to Plone and quite helpful as a kick-starter, but I would not by any means recommend it for use as a ""bible"" for what Plone is, can do, and can be customized to do today."
1853,3,"""I Enjoyed This Book""","I read this book last year with my book club ""Sistahs With A Vision"". I enjoyed the storyline but the Adrian Betrayal episodes started to bore me. I truly enjoyed this book overall. I look forward to the next book!!!!!!!!Rhonda Gibson, Founder, First Annual African American Book Clubs & Readers Retreat 2000, 13-15 October 2000, Cherry Hill Hilton, Cherry Hill, New Jersey"
1854,2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"TOOOO LONG AND DRAWN OUT. Reading this book, I found myself saying, ""GET TO THE POINT."" The plot of the story was nice (sort of), but it needed more action. In the beginning and towards the end there was too much talk about what I already heard over and over before. What really bothered me was that one character's point of view, didn't really give me an understanding of the other characters (especially Adrian).Before reading this book the title caught my attention. The title was really a big let down because there was not much ""Hell Breaking Loose."" Borrow this book from a friend and please don't ever buy the hard back."
1855,4,Pretty good read,"Let's see -- the thing I loved the most about this book is the surprising twist. While I was reading it, at first I couldn't tell what was going on, but after I realized what happened, I felt the story was quite interesting to say the least. I must commend Ms. Spencer on her first novel and I look forward to ""Cubicles."""
1856,5,Too hot to put down.,"Camika, I feel you girl. You are an awesome writer. I knew this story was too good to be true. What was wrong with Adrian? Mother knows best. Gregs mother knew something wasn't right about Adrian.Church going Shreese. She was just plain silly. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. My heart went out to Greg because he was all ready to settle down with Adrian but she had to go and mess things up.Camila, I await your next novel. Keep up the good work. Be Blessed!"
1857,4,Remembered a Great Movie,"""Lilies of the Field"" was a great movie when first released. It is still as good as I remembered. Sidney Poiter deserved the Oscar that he received."
1858,5,Buying good movies,This was a wondeful process. I would buy from Amazon again and again. It is especially great for the older hard to find movies.If anyone knows how to find the movie Madame X with Lana Turner and John Forsyth let me know. I haven't been able to find it anywhere. Thanks again
1859,5,A heartwarming classic,"This movie is a true classic that has endured the test of time. Great performances by all, Sydney Poiter is amazing in his role as a construction/handyman who meets up with a group of German who want him to ""build them a shapel (chapel)"". An inspiring testimony to the power of prayer (and a little hard work). A true must see for all ages!"
1860,2,2 Good Songs,"This album was basically horrible the only 2 good songs were the 2 singles ""Tush"" & ""Run"" the rest of the album was trash. I would definitely not recommend this album. All the beats are horrible and the collaborations suck too."
1861,4,Pretty Toney Album - Ghostface ( 4.5 stars),"Ghostface had alot to live up to with this LP after droping such classiscs as 'Iron man' & 'Supreme Clientele', and if you ask me, he did. The album starts off pretty good with the mixtape banga 'Biscuits' featuring Ghost's protege' Trife of the Theodore Unit, then on to ""Kunta Fly Sh*t"" it's kind of like an interlude, but really good. Throgh the first half the album is golden with cuts like ""Beat the Clock"" and the 2/3 of the Lox assisted ""Metal Lungies"". It's the other half of the album that brings it down with tracks like ""Tush"" ,""Ghostface"" , and ""Tooken Back"" but don't get me wrong ""Tooken Back"" is not a bad track but is just not up to par with the others. Luckily the album is saved with the classics "" Beat the Clock"" & ""Run"". 'The Pretty Toney Album' is just short of a classic but with the unfitting tracks ""Tush"", ""Ghostface"" , and ""Tooken Back"" just holds the album down."
1862,5,tight as f*ck,"This is a great cd. Ghost and Kanye West are here to save hip-hop and theyre doin a damn goog job of it. My favorite song is ""Biscuits"". Minus the skit, which are the only things i dont like about the cd, the whole album is amazing. You can almost feel his lyrics on every song"
1863,3,House wife,It wasn't as entertaining as I thought it would be. Not bad but just not what I wanted to read
1864,1,unuseful for this day and age...,I love frugal and economical but this book made no sense to me. Reminds me of the foxwoods books but not nearly as useful.My first Kindle book that I had to delete without even reading half.
1865,3,keep it in historic perspective,"It was interesting for local recipes and ways to do housekeeping,however the rules of being a wife and good mother seem so restrictivecompared to today's lifestyle."
1866,2,Frugal Housewife,"I was really hoping that this book would have up-to-date tips on saving money. A few pages into the book, I realized that rarely did the suggestions apply to today's world. I was only able to read just a few pages. Disappointing."
1867,2,Poor Facsimile,"This reprint is a facimile of the original edition, but is poorly reproduced. It is a print-on-demand edition, and the original was scanned in halftone mode so that all the text has a dot-screen pattern making it uncomfortable to read."
1868,5,"If you love the Anime, you'll love the Soundtrack","1 of 3 different soundtracks, this installment of the Trigun soundtracks is great. It flows with the series as it should and has some really good songs. A deffinate buy for any Trigun lover."
1869,4,great movie,"jet li as usual made fast well choreographed amzing fight sceens.I found there were to many times where it looked like they were flying and it get's anoying after a while, but overall this was a really good movie and should be seen by every jet li fan."
1870,3,Jackie Chan is NOT in this movie!,"I'm not sure what movie Amazon thinks this is, but it's actually a Wong Fei Hong pic starring Jet Li. And it's not his best, either. Yuen Woo-Ping did do the action choreography so it does have great fight scenes. Story was lacking though. Please, Amazon, try to get the titles and stars on these Chinese movies correct for once."
1871,2,Not One of His Best,"I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars."
1872,4,Call of the Canyon,"Zane Grey gives a good description of the emotional attachment people develop to the canyons of the West. I grew up there, and I enjoyed the book."
1873,3,A good read like all of Zane Grey's Westerns,I like reading any book by Zane Grey. Some of his books should be ranked among the Classics. There is no reason for excluding westerns from this accolade
1874,4,A wonderful romantic Western.,"The story set in the 1920s New York and Arizona is a wonderful romance. The descriptions of the canyons and desert make me want to pack up the car and head out for an extended vacation in Arizona right away. The descriptions are indeed moving.The downside of the novel for me is just a little bit too much ""philosophy"" out of the post WW1 era. Grey harps a little to much on his ideal American Woman, American Family, the contrast between the idle rich in New York and the working folks out on the range in The West. There is way too much writing on the plight of W.W.I vets when they returned to America. But in spite of a lot of pages devoted to teaching Grey's message there is a wonderful romantic story to be enjoyed."
1875,1,Boring book,"I had to buy this book for a class. It is the most BORING book ever. If you don't have to buy this, please save yourself the misery of having to read it and don't!"
1876,3,I hope your tech-jutsu is strong,"A bit of tech know-how is needed to make the game playable on XP/Vista/7 (Primarily running EVERYTHING in Windows 95 Compatibility mode), and hunting down the patches is recommended. And even then the game freezes when you get close to winning the campaign. Setting that aside, its a fun game for anyone who's a fan of old-skool hexagonal turn based strategy gaming."
1877,4,?,What can I say-it's Sean Paul. I bought the cd for my BF. Different version than the radio and only two songs on the cd. But he seems to like it. Did arrive quickly.
1878,3,"Keeps coffee warm, at best.","I guess I shouldn't expect much out of a product labeled as a ""mug warmer"" but I was hoping that the temperature of the heating plate would be higher than it actually is.I find that it works best if you do not fill your mug to the brim as the mug is only be able to conduct the heat up to its middle.I have yet to try this but I assume it would also be more effective on mugs that do not have concave bottoms/ends, meaning that the bottom of the mug is directly in contact with the heating plate.Overall, I guess it does it's job. Nothing more, nothing less."
1879,3,It's ok,It works ok. I had one before that kept the coffee super hot. This one keeps it warm. I guess it's better than it going cold.
1880,4,Works good,Works good. Would like it to be hotter because it doesnt seem to keep my tea real hot but than I touch the top and OUCH so maybe they should make a mug that goes with this that will conduct the heat better. What I'd like to see. Great item for the price though.
1881,2,Minimal heat and not much longevity,"First of all, the heat was not very impressive on this thing. Secondly, I received this item on December 20, 2011; it is now September 19, 2012, and it has already stopped working (Just shy of 9 months). I last used it 24 hours ago, and I just went to use it again, but there is nothing; no light, no heat, it's just dead. I may have only paid $8 for this, but I am not happy that I have to now order another one so soon. I will definitely be looking into another brand or model, because I don't want this to happen again."
1882,1,TOTALLY USELESS!! READ THIS REVIEW,"I bought 3 of these for myself and 2 co-workers. (so its not that I got a faulty one) All 3 of us used it and agreed they are useless. Your drink will stay luke warm at best.It does ""warm"" the bottom of the mug though, so technically it isn't false advertising.Thanks for another crap product China."
1883,2,Gunk,"This device does well enough keeping the coffee warm, but I have black gunk along the bottom of every cup and mug that has sat on the warming pad, which seems to come off only with a long soaking in CLR."
1884,5,Great gift and a very useful item,"I purchased the Mug Warmer as a Christmas gift for a relative. Within a few days after opening the gift, I got a phone call raving about how fantastic and useful this item is. Good idea, and oh so practical."
1885,5,Warmer for winter,"This is nice, and big enough for my small teapot at bedside when I like to slowly pour and sip my hot tea while watching a movie, it not only keeps hot tea warm, it even heats it up slowly if I need it to."
1886,3,Not hot enough,I bought three of these mug warmers. i like the on/off switch feature. The only thing i don't like is it could keep my tea a little 'warmer!'
1887,2,"Amost, but not quite there.",It looks good and functions well but the temperature is just not quite as hot as most coffee and tea drinkers prefer. Another 10-15 degrees and it would be perfect.
1888,5,Awesome mug warmer!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend who practices piano all day and often lets his coffee go cold. He adores it! He says it keeps is coffee the perfect temperature. And if he's happy, then I'm happy with the purchase, too."
1889,4,mug warmer as advertised,The advertisement for this warmer indicated it had the only two features that were important to me....on-off switch accessable on the warmer top and a top-visible on-pilot light. The blow-up feature on the sales/ad was very helpful in confirming these features. Product arrived promptly and was packaged very well. And-most importantly..it is still working!!
1890,3,Warmer could be warmer,"This warmer keeps your drink warm, but if you want it to stay hot, this is probably not what you want. In all fairness, I have not found one that works any better, though. Maybe there is a federal safety standard on how hot they can be."
1891,4,Might vary from user to user,"Pulled the trigger despite the number of ""this doesn't work"" reviews out there.Not clear if the issue is with specific units, the type of mug you use, or personal expectation on how hot you expect your drink to be, but this is working for me exactly as expected.I've got a giant ceramic mug that holds over half a liter of liquid. I've found that if I turn on the warmer when I go to make my drink, the drink stays hot enough for me to enjoy until I finish it, which this morning took about 45 minutes. Without the warmer, within 20 minutes, the drink was into the lukewarm stage.The drink wasn't as hot at the end as it was at the start, but it definitely was ""hot"" and not ""warm"".I did try using it to reheat a half-full cup at one point, and I definitely would have been better off taking 3 minutes to use the microwave, but even there, it managed to take the drink from room temperature to tepid.Count me in the ""it works for me"" column."
1892,5,Mr. Coffee Mjg Beverage Warmer,"The Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer works as it should. Has a convenient on/off switch on the warmer, which is better than on the cord. Keeps coffee at the proper temperature."
1893,3,Adequate for the price,"I've had this warmer for over a year now and while it keeps my tea warm, it goes nowhere near keeping it ""hot."" It's beginning to lose the black paint over the metal heating disc in the center, but remains serviceable. The price offers a decent value."
1894,4,Pleased with my purchase,I have used the coffee warmer for several weeks now and I find that it keeps my coffee hot down to the last swallow. I would recommend this to others wanting a good working coffee warmer
1895,1,one step above ice cold,dose not keep coffee hot a step above ice cold I was very disappointed I though since it was a Mr. coffee it would be what I wanted wouldn't not buy again.
1896,3,Not. Hot enough,More heat I like my coffee hot! Not warm enough to keep coffee hot what more do you want to know?
1897,4,"Good, but wish it was hotter","Good solid product, built well, good switch and cord. However, I like my tea/coffe HOT, and this keeps it marginally warm enough for me."
1898,1,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer,Mr. Coffee Mug Warmer is a total waste of money. Only keeps drinks lukewarm at best. Not very satisfying at all.Mr Coffee MWBLK Mug Warmer
1899,3,Not the 'hottest' coffee warmer in the world....,"I researched 'coffee warmers' and noted the 'other' reviews but bought this anyway. Not a bad warmer....just not as hot as I would like it to be.If the coffee is really hot, it does an OK job.....but if the converse is true....it has a problem. Would I buy another? No, I would probably trya different brand. This is not to say that you 'wouldn't like it'. The price was right on and it got to me really fast. Try it, you might like it!"
1900,1,Broke after 1 1/2 years,Used the warmer for almost two winters and it has stopped working now. Worked great during the first winter. They don't make them like they used to.
1901,4,it's ok,"bought two for myhusband he thinks that it doesnt keep the coffee hot enough, but he likes it really hot"
1902,4,mug warmer,Great Service & Item as described...this is a must for any person who likes hot drinks to stay hot while busy working.
1903,1,Not even luke warm,"I almost knew this thing was going to be a hunk of crap from some of the reviews... but I figured I would see for myself. Yeah, this thing doesn't even keep liquid in a mug luke warm. It is junk. At least Amazon's return policy is 100% good-to-go."
1904,1,Worked like a charm! FOR 5 MINUTES,"Really wanted this to work, but sadly disappointed. Literally worked for about 5 minutes and then stopped heating altogether. How difficult can it be to make such a device that actually works?"
1905,1,Low Quality,"I make a very large mug of Tea in the morning. By the time I finish it, it is usually cold. I bought this thinking that it would allow me to have hot tea all morning.When I first got it the heat output was not too bad, it would keep something warm but wouldn't heat up something cold. That is for the 2 days it worked. Thats right, it only took 2 days before it gave out. Now it does not heat up at all. I have learned my lesson, buy a thermos."
1906,4,warms mug of coffee,I got this to keep a cup of coffee warm and it does the job. I don't expect it to heat up anything. Two years of use and still going strong. Only 4 stars because the paint is wearing off. Seems more cosmetic than anything. Plus a plastic piece of the edge recently broke. A touch of glue fixed it and I expect it will continue do its job. It stays in one place and isn't subject to abuse or bumps etc so I was a bit taken aback by the piece breaking off.
1907,5,I'm pleasantly surprised,"I wasn't expecting too much from this, but it actually kept my drink and mug really warm! I decided to give it a good test and I had hot tea in a taller mug and left it for several hours. The tea is still very warm! It's actually a perfect drinking temperature for me. I tend to drink slowly, and my drink always gets cold before I'm done, so I am very pleased with this mug warmer."
1908,4,First one that actually works,"This is the second one I tried. It actually works. It does get really hot, though. I wouldn't want very young children too near it."
1909,5,does the job,This warmer is exactly as advertised. Of course it won't warm cold water but it does keep beverages hot. I placed a mug of hot chocolate direct from the micro wave on the warmer and 2 1/2 hours later it was hotter than before. My wife loves it. She doesn't have to bug me to get up and heat her beverages anymore.
1910,2,Mr. Coffee Warmer Not Too Hot,"The Mr. Coffee warmer does not produce enough heat to keep a beverage in a typical coffee mug warm. The wattage should be higher. In addition, earlier models had a somewhat higher wattage and an automatic shutoff if the cup was not lifted from the warmer for a period of time, approximately 10 minutes. When the cup was lifted, the timer would reset. Also, when the cup was lifted, the warmer would shut off until the cup was replaced on the warmer. The current model does not have either of these safety features. Once you turn the warmer on, it stays on until turned off with the manual switch on the warmer (if you remember to turn it off)."
1911,4,Works well with a normal mug,Keeps drinks hot enough when used with a normal mug. Using an overly large mug seems to dissipate heat more. For best results I swirl the beverage when I take a sip to keep the temperature consistent inside.
1912,2,Does not keep my beverage hot or even very warm,"Simply put, it does not keep my beverage hot or very warm. I've tried using different mugs and this thing is just not doing to the job. I read all the reviews before purchasing and gathered that I might have to try different mugs but that was not the case. The only reason I give it two stars is because it happens to keep my hot beverage warmer a bit longer (3 mins maybe?) than it would if I didnt have the warmer but in the end it cools down just the same. I would not purchase again."
1913,3,A brief note on soundtrack influences...,"As noted by a previous reviewer, the title Big O song sounds a lot like Queen. That's because it IS Queen, not influenced by. That song is the title track ""Flash"" from the movie FLASH GORDON which Queen did the entire soundtrack for. That Queen wasn't credited for that song is plagarism, pure and simple.Other than that, the Big O soundtrack is great at creating the various moods during the show."
1914,1,Boring and old,"I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!"
1915,3,Good info,"For someone that wants a dane this book is complete with training info and pictures. It helps with how to take care of your dane and alerts you to the aliments danes are prone to. Great Danes are like gentle giants. For those of you that want one, but don't want to deal with house breaking and teething, there is a Great Dane rescue organizations with danes that are looking for good homes."
1916,4,Easy but fun read!!!,"Mature adult here, didn't even realize when I grabbed this book that it was meant for teens... I can see how it would be appropriate for teens, but thoroughly enjoyed it! Easy to glide through (though I'm usually a pretty quick reader) but made for a very enjoyable weekend afternoon! I do recommend this to anyone who enjoys fantasy stories. A bit more simplistic (but not overly so) than many of the fantasy novels out there, but sometimes that's refreshing when your brain is tired. The primary characters are engaging, and the author makes you care about them quickly... all in all a fun read."
1917,1,Defective Product,The product was delivered on time. When I inspected the bench I noticed one of the Upright Stanchions had improperly drilled holes to connect the Upright Cross Bar. Thus the bench was unusable. Called customer service for Phoenix health and Fitness INC. Hopefully they will be able to remedy the situations. Until then I just wasted my money.
1918,2,Not too useful,"Although the logic sections of this book provide suffiecent tips, the math section lacked depth. I would not recommend this book as a primary soure, rather careful study of regular school curriculum should make you do well on this test. After all it is a test of what you have learned. Nothing prepares you more than keeping up regularly."
1919,4,"If you like the movie, buy the CD!",A nice CD composed of the songs from the movie series Macross Plus.
1920,3,Fundamental Liberal Policies.,"This book details what John Kenneth Galbraith views as a ""good society"" with what can be achieved and admitting there are goals that can't realistically be reached.Mr. Galbraith observed that the percentage of the poor that don't vote is mirrored by the high percentage of rich that do vote.His view on wealth and power was insightful- ""Power serves the acquisition of income; income accords power over the pecuniary reward of others."" Page 65.His assessment of corporate greed was almost prophetic-""Personal profit maximization, that universally acclaimed motivation, can and does extend to those who effectively head the firm."" Page 17.The downside with this book from one of my favorite authors on the subject of economics is the age of it.A lot has transpired in the world of politics, global business, and economics since this book was published in 1997.The book does serve very well as a primer on liberal economics."
1921,1,One episode cannot define a season,"Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion ""Lex Luthor"" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"
1922,4,The stakes are getting even higher,"Things have heated up far beyond dealing with Lex and Lionel and even with Lana. Now, Clark, Chloe, Lois, and Oliver must face Zod and the remaining Kandorians, as well as a shadowy group called Checkmate, in a battle for control of the Earth and peace and freedom for its inhabitants.Clark's mom shows up briefly, as do members of the Justice League. And the red-blue blur makes quite a few appearances around town.Things will be wrapping up in season 10. Can't wait!"
1923,5,Smallville season 9,I'm a huge fan and I really enjoy this series. It is definately in my top 3 tv shows. I ordered this for my brother so he could enjoy the adventure as well.
1924,1,LAME,"Ok, so they had a good thing going for a while with the super villains in season eight, but rather than actually finishing a story line, they drop it and start over with something else. LAME"
1925,3,Truth or Legend?,Are you looking for perfect Hollywood entertainment with breathtaking stunts in the air and handsome actors? Go for this video straight away!!! Would you rather know more about the life and times of Manfred von Richthofen and what really happened the day he died? Are you more interested in well- researched movies and historical correctness? Then leave it.
1926,4,I'm stuck on Moonstruck,"This is a delightful romantic comedy. Cher does a wonderful job of changing from a frumpy, overworked fiancee to a glamorous, sexy girlfriend of Nicholas Cage. Good performances by everyone."
1927,2,Moonstruck,"This being my all time favorite movie, I bought this DVD as a backup to one I already have. I was not so impressed as the main menu was different (look and music) and the contents indicated on the back cover of this ""deluxe edition"" were not there (recepies, etc) I fail to see what is so ""deluxe"" about it. I will always recommend this movie but maybe not the ""deluxe edition"" because it is nothing special. I also had problems starting it (I initially thought something was wrong with my DVD player. . .haven't watched it again as my original version is much better."
1928,3,Why only Full Screen?,Love the film. But why is it only available in Full Screen format? That's pretty annoying.
1929,1,dull and not funny,"i have always been a fan of romantic comedies, and i've even been able to enjoy formulaic ones such as the wedding planner and it could happen to you, but this movie is just too awful. the acting is atrocious and cher is just way too old for the part (is she supposed to look fifty?). personally i love nicholas cage but there is nothing appealing about his character in this movie and the thick black hair all over his body certainly doesn't help.none of this would have annoyed me greatly had the lines in this movie not been so hokey and badly delivered. i think i laughed, at most, twice, which is sad since i am easily amused if the lines are halfway witty. if you rent this movie you probably won't die from sheer mortification that such a bad movie could be made, but Moonstruck is certainly not a good enough movie to buy!"
1930,5,WHY IS THIS NOT AVAILABLE IN WIDESCREEN????,"This is one of my 3 favorite movies. I have the laserdisc, but I will not upgrade to DVD unless it's widescreen. Every other good movie from 1987 (a bumper crop year) is available in this format. Please, please, please, do this little thing!"
1931,1,Great Movie -- Junk DVD,"Nothing is more irritating than seeing the message: ""this movie has been altered from its orignal theatrical presentation. It has been reformatted to fit your screen"" when your watching it on a WIDESCREEN TV and you END UP WITH BLACK BARS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT! How arrogent of them to assume that ""your screen"" will always be an old-fashioned 4:3 format TV!!This may be the only DVD I can think of that isn't available in widescreen. Save your money and spend it on a product produced by people with more regard for their customers."
1932,5,"Please please please, distributors : WIDESCREEN","This is one of my favorite movies, but I won't convert to the DVD version until widescreen. As so many of us have already complained, ""what were you people thinking?????"""
1933,5,A Superb Meal of Love,"This is a wonderful film to watch with a girlfriend, wife or woman you are interested in. Why? It is passionate, funny, romantic, lunatic, sweet and truthful. Cher has never been a performer I cherish, or even admire, but here is the best work I've seen her in. She is beautiful and excellent in the part. Nic Cage is also excessive in the most melodramatic, stereotypical Italian way, a way which this film mines toward gold. Olympia Dukakis owns all the scenes she is in, and with Vincent Gardinia, the two make for a beautiful and interesting couple. It isn't long, boring or dumb. Highly recommended."
1934,4,Moonstruck,"I like watching this movie especially with the big name talent in this film. Cher was wonderful and a young Nicholas Cage was entertaining as well. The look into old Italian family was nastalgic and comfy, and the music was wonderfuly supportive of the atmosphere. PG 13 easy not bad language, no nude scenes, focus on the story and plot which moved forward at a good pace."
1935,5,You will laugh and cry with joy....,"A ""feel good movie"" if ever there were one...Funny and Romantic...some great supporting actors other than Cher and Cage. A movie to invite a couple over to your house for ""dinner and a movie""..."
1936,5,Great characters,"The movie has wonderful characters, well played. Every one of them. The story line of finding and maintaining loving relationships within a loyal family is quite special."
1937,5,moonstuck,This is one of the best films of all time. the cast is supurb Cher is brilliant and what can I say about Olyumpia DucarKis but fabulas the whole film is brilliant Watch it and if you don't agree with me then there is something wrong with You!Yours FaithfullyShaun Warburton
1938,1,no track listings,"I WOULD LOVE TO RATE & PURCHASE THIS CD BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS THE TWO SONGS THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. IF YOU COULD HELP ME, I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT."
1939,4,"Out of date, but good!!","A bit out of date; soooo funny, because I don't think I'll be using words and phrases like ""typewriter"" or ""will you close the porthole"" although it's charming to see. It's very helpful however, and I'm excited to have it!!"
1940,4,A good book about the Holy Spirit,"Another good book by Billy Graham. I recommend you to read it. I agree with most of what Dr Graham is saying about the Holy Spirit but regarding ""speaking in tounges"" I disagree with him. I think it is for every believer and for edification of the induvidual believer. I also think he is to unclear about the need of baptism. I see nothing in the bible to support child baptism and think he should put more effort on making it clear that every believer fist should repent from their sins and receive the Lord Jesus and then be baptised in water.But otherwise it is a very good book."
1941,5,A necessity in every sense,"Some facts about Harold Bloom. He taught himself to read English (his family spoke Yiddish at home) at the age of 3 or 4. He has a photographic memory for text, and has more or less the whole canon of English poetry committed to memory.Now granted, these facts don't guarantee genius by themselves, but Bloom has something extra to add to those other traits--an imaginative hunger and an enormous love for poetry and what it can do for the individual, sensitive reader.Admittedly, this analysis of Blake owes quite a bit to Northrop Frye's ""Fearful Symmetry,"" but there are many new insights that make this book worth much more than its price. Whatever one may think about Bloom's later literary analyses, his early work has, undeniably, the stamp of genius."
1942,3,Why did they have to change a good thing?,"I have to agree with other reviewers, I just don't get why they changed the diapers to be so crunchy and chemical smelling. I had not planned on using Pampers but we were given pampers in the hospital and loved them and decided it was worth the extra to stick with them. But going to try others. If you like these new stinky pampers, Amazon has consistently had the best price."
1943,3,Just an Average Diaper....,"This is a good diaper for the most part. I do like that they are thin so they don't take up much room in the diaper bag, nor do they make my child's rear end ""puffy"". I do, however, have an issue with them overnight. I suppose my baby is a heavy wetter compared to most, or at least I'm assuming, because she wakes up soaked every morning. I change right before I lay her down and that diaper is SO full and leaking. Very unhappy with that, but I don't know what else to do."
1944,5,You got to try them!!!,Love Pampers Baby Dry..I use them for both my 1 and 2 year olds and it works great. I never had a leak problem or any rashes!!
1945,5,I won't use anything else!,"As a first-time mom I found that all my friends used Pampers on their children, so naturally I decided to use Pampers as well and I love them! The Baby Dry diapers are thin, fit great and do not leak. I was given another brand of diapers at my baby-shower and we do not like them at all. In fact, we still have a partially unused package because we'd rather pay for the superior quality of Pampers than deal with the leakage from the free diapers."
1946,1,Does not keep your baby dry,"So I bought these diapers because I have used the Swaddlers before with success. My daughter is 9 weeks old, 10 pounds and uses size 1. For anyone that has not used Swaddlers, the difference between the two is clearly the quality as the diaper is much thinner, almost paper thin. Upon the first use of this diaper, I noticed that after a 2 hour nap, my daughter's onesie was was wet. I gave the diaper another chance, and had exactly the same issue. I would not recommend this diaper as I believe the whole purpose of a diaper is to keep the baby dry."
1947,4,No more leaks,"These baby dry diapers live up to their name. We used to use Luvs and Huggies and our little guy had us changing the sheets sometimes 2 or more times per day. Since changing to Pampers Baby Dry diapers, we only change the sheets when they get dirty. What a concept. It may sound like a small thing, but it's not one to overlook.(Did that sound like too much of a commercial? Oh well, it's early...)"
1948,5,Great product for the price,Have been buying diapers for all my grandchildren and by far Pampers Baby Dry have been the best buy for the price. No compliants only good feed back from the parents.
1949,5,Best Available Disposables,"I have four children and have tried all the available disposables, including other Pampers diapers. I love Pampers Baby Dry the best. I do not have leak issues and by using the Amazon Subscribe and Save method they are also very economical for me."
1950,2,These diapers don't do their job.,"These diapers have a design flaw. When my baby has a BM, a small amount seeps through the diaper so I put two of these on so her clothes do not get messy."
1951,2,What happened pampers?,"I've been diapering babies for the last 12 years straight and have always loved pampers. My kids are sensitive to other brands so I have to use the name brands and pampers never lets me down. Until this box. I have purchased this brand/size/box count before (months ago) with no problems but for some reason every single diaper in this last box leaks. He is soaking wet every time I put one on him. It doesn't matter if he's awake or asleep he's soaked through his onesie, shirt, and pants as soon as he goes. It's almost as if there's nothing absorbant in there. The urine leaks through the entire outside cover. I thought maybe it was the baby at first so I kept using them but after switching back to cruisers and another name brand in the same size no leaks at all. Now I have a huge box of expensive diapers I can't use. Not happy!"
1952,2,Pampers diapers - have they changed???,"I was tired of the tabs on luvs and decided to go back to pampers, but when I tried both the cruisers and baby dry diapers this time around, they both gave my little guy diaper rash (they didn't do that a year and a half ago). The baby dry didn't do it as bad as the cruisers. I love pampers products - both the baby dry diapers and the cruisers as well (great fit, quality product), but they are useless if they give your little one diaper rash. Otherwise, amazon does a great job delivering their product."
1953,5,Great Diapers for my baby,Pampers diapers are excellent for the babies who are sensitive to the diaper rash. they worked well on my baby skin.
1954,3,Average diapers - better options on the market,"I only use these because I've gotten a huge supply for free. The construction of these diapers seem flimsy compared to Seventh Generation (best diapers) and Huggies Little Movers. Every time my little one pees, they fill up like soggy water balloons. They also smell extra funky when they're peed and of course pooped. I don't mean like just poop, but like poop and artificial scent mixed together. Not a good combo. My little used to get terrible butt rash from Pampers Swaddlers, but these don't give her any rashes. For the price, they're not that bad. I think they are an OK value, just know that there are better options if price isn't the priority."
1955,1,Terrible.,"Well I'm not sure what Pampers has done but these baby dry diapers are awful. My son has been in Huggies for a long time and I thought we would give these a try since the price is a pretty good deal through Amazon. I'm sorry I did. These are VERY thin diapers and the quality is extremely poor. These are definitely not the baby dry diapers I used on my older son a few years ago. These are completely white, no design at all. They used to have cute Sesame Street designs on them. The sides are not very stretchy and the diaper easily gets pushed down by clothing. We have had leaking at night because of this. Also, when the diaper has been on for a while (like at night) it's like the diapers shreds a bit around the leg openings. I assume this is due to rubbing against clothing for extended periods of time. I will NOT be buying these again. I'm sorry I bought such a big box since most of these will go to waste. Pampers Cruisers however, are great."
1956,1,causes diaper rash... i returned it,They caused diaper rash. I changed to Huggies and they were gone. We have used pampers over last 6 years for my kids but i will never use Baby -Dry again.
1957,5,cheapest price,"When using the subscribe and save, it is the cheapest price than all the stores I checked. (walmart, Target, Babiesrus)"
1958,1,Not good for baby bums,"I bought these when they were a killer deal. I have a 4 month old and I have never used this brand before. BAD MISTAKE! They ended up giving my little girl a burn-like rash on her bottom and I only used 2 of them. It took almost a week for it to go away after I switched back to huggies. It was NOT a diaper rash, it was way worse, it happened almost instantly after I started use. I would not recommend to anyone. After I returned these (can I just say Amazon has the best customer service EVER!!!) I read reviews of other moms on different websites and it seems like I am not the only one this has happened too."
1959,1,late shipping!!!,"Placed an order on 09/08/04, today is 10/08/04.I've been waiting for 1 month already and it still has not been shipped!!!Are you challenging the customers' patience???"
1960,5,Work just as well as the more expensive options--maybe better,"I used to buy Pampers Cruisers for my son, perhaps thinking if they cost more they must work better. Who knows. Then Cruisers added the Dry Max and my son started getting a rash. Thank goodness, becuase I switched to these diapers and realized they work just as well, are significantly cheaper, and don't have the perfume that caused the rash. Just a note: they do seem to run slightly smaller than Cruisers and Swaddlers when you order the same size."
1961,4,good,"Exelente I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
1962,3,Just ok.....,I love pampers but for some reason these ones leak all the time!I have to change my son twice a day because his diapers would leak. Switching to a different brand.
1963,5,LOVE,I love pampers and this was a good buy. I would buy again if needed to but my little one now is potty trained.
1964,2,"Baby is not dry in Baby Dry, Prefer Swaddlers","I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for my son (now 13 months old) and highly recommend THIS brand of Pampers. My goal was to order the same brand from Amazon but the only brand available on Amazon was Pampers Baby Dry diapers so I decided to give it a try, because after all, it is still made by Pampers, a name I trust. I do NOT recommend Baby Dry diapers. My son would stay dry in the Swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the Baby Dry diapers. The diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front, so he would be wet all over, in his diaper, his pjs, and his bedding, overnight in this diaper. He also developed more diaper rashes from wearing this diaper compared to the other one. I love the delivery service Amazon provides, but I will not get Baby Dry again."
1965,2,Pampers Baby Dry,I am not a fan of the pampers baby dry. I have a 16 month old and when the diaper gets wet it starts to sag in the bottom to the point where it looks funny and I am sure is uncomfortable for her. The fact that she is such a mover I think makes this not a great diaper for her age. The pamper cruisers are great and that is what she is wearing now. Before I could not decide between the baby dry size 5 and the cruisers size 5 because I really didn't know what the difference was and now I do! The fit!
1966,5,great value and fit,I got a great deal with the Subscribe & Save option and coupon codes! Pampers Baby Dry diapers fit great and are less bulky so work well with tights.
1967,1,"Terrible, Leaky, Useless Diapers","We couldn't be more disappointed with these diapers. We bought them for our 20-month old daughter to wear at nighttime and not once have they kept her dry. They leak through the front, the legs, the back, you name it. Really poor quality and they've put us off Pampers for life. Stay away."
1968,4,Good Product,Got here a few days later than expected but Ive used Pampers for awhile. NOT good for little babies but GREAT for toddlers. NOT a good fit but much more absorbent than Huggies. I reccomend Huggies for up to 18 mos. about 12 mos and up i reccomend pampers
1969,5,"Great Diapers, Great Price","I used to be a fan of Luvs but then they changed their materials and now they feel very plasticy rather than cloth-like. I like these diapers because they feel nearly cloth like, which if you are a new parent, that means they BREATHE and that reduces the amount of Diaper Rashes that your child might have.With the Amazon Mom pricing you get 30% off which makes these a steal. Whenever I run out before I received my new shipment, I always have sticker shock at the prices. In my neighborhood store, a 30pk are almost 11$ and that's the average."
1970,1,These diapers leak!,"I've used Pampers Cruisers and Pull-ups and both work great...but these Baby Dry Pampers are awful. They leak probably once a day. I've never had this experience before with other diapers which hold the wetness much better. I will be shopping for a different kind. This is ridiculous, no way should they leak as much as they do...very frustrating."
1971,4,Pampers Baby Dry,"This is the first time we dried anything other than snugglers or swaddlers. Definitely a great price. Lasted us more than two months. So far, after one month of usage, their haven't been any leaks or blow outs. They fit our fairly small son well enough. No rashes or reactions either."
1972,4,Sizing information,"Great product, but it would be helpful if the brand could post sizing info (eg. size 2 = 10 to 16 lbs).Thanks"
1973,1,Not worth the money,"I purchased the Pampers Baby Dry by mistake and I hated them. They leak and they are hard. Pampers Swaddlers are excellent they NEVER leak, they are soft and comfortable for my baby boy. Stick with the Swaddlers or you'll not only be changing the babies diaper more often but you'll be changing the babies clothes and bedding too."
1974,3,i prefer Huggies,i bought these to try since they were a little cheaper than Huggies. I usually use basic Huggies. I find that these diapers feel cheaper than the Huggies. I will use this box up and then move back to the Huggies. Note that these diapers haven't leaked through. i just think that the Huggies are a better built diaper. These Pampers may be fine for most.
1975,5,Love!,"great quality, great price, never leaks, no blowouts = win!We only purchase pampers diapers now. The cute pattern of sesame street is nice to have, the tabs are soft and easily visable (pale green) rather than having to look for them, they're obvious. These smell good and stack well. We are big fans"
1976,1,"""Baby Dry"" makes baby ""wet""","I have been using the Pampers Swaddlers for 8 months but decided to try the ""Baby Dry"" because of the reviews and price. What a mistake!!! Do not get these. Every morning, my son wakes up completely wet......leaving the sheets & mattress cover wet too. When the diaper gets wet, the moisture does not lock away from the baby....and the diaper gets weighed down. They are awful! I just wish I didn't order the 222 count. I am stuck with these for awhile."
1977,2,Not great for newborns.,"I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home."
1978,3,Okay Diaper,"This diaper normally does the job but occasionally will leak in the mornings.My 14 month old son's pajamas will be damp in the front. Also,an issue I have been having,are the tabs will sometimes break off. This is a waste of a whole diaper.I have wasted about 10-15 diapers in a pack due to this."
1979,5,Amazon is crafty and nauseous,"When I reorder the product through Amazon's Subscribe & Save Section. I can't imput the extra 20% off promotion code when checking out. And the system placed order for me right now. Couple minutes later, I figure out the way to use the coupon by setting up a new order through Subscribe & Save Section and I place a new order which will save 20% for me. However, I find the previous order by the system can not be cancelled while the new cheaper order can be modefied. Just several minutes! The only thing I can do is to cancel the later, the cheaper one. Amazon is so smart and nauseous."
1980,2,Not great!,I'm disappointed in these diapers. My daughter frequently wakes up in the morning covered in clumps of gel from inside the diaper. It's not hurting anything but it's a pain to clean up.
1981,4,Better than huggies!,"Much better than huggies diapers. They hold liquid better and fit my 27lb daughter much better as well. She's almost 2 so hopefully around then we'll go to either pullups or real underwear then. In the meantime though... we'll stick with these. I've tried Luvs and I've tried huggies.... and for whatever reason neither of them fit our daughter particularly well. She's on the tall but slender side so while even the size 3 diapers would fit her a the waist, they don't come up high enough to really be effective. Add in that these hold way more liquid than the size 4 diapers.... and we're doing good."
1982,1,"Leaks a lot! Keeps baby really messy, not dry and clean!!","I hate these diapers! Always leaks even at day time! Poop would always come out, as in every time my son poops! Whenever we go out i make sure my son has 2-3 sets of xtra clothes coz he is always messed up! Im sooo disappointed in pampers! I eould rather use cheap brands or rather switch back to my trusted huggies diapers."
1983,2,Baby dry is not as good as swaddlers,I was a new mom and therefore pretty tired. I didn't notice that there was a difference between baby dry and swaddlers and accidentally bought baby dry. They are more plastic and didn't seem to let my baby's skin breathe nearly as well as the swaddlers. I won't buy the baby dry again!
1984,3,I like swaddlers better,These diapers are great but I do prefer swaddlers version. They are not as soft as the swaddlers but aside from that they get the job done.
1985,1,Leaks and full of strong chemicals,"I was trying to save money by going with these instead of some of the natural diapers (a few cents more per diaper) but I quickly regretted it. I've never had leaks with the natural diapers but these leaked every night. Little gooey balls came out of the diapers and stuck to my daughter's skin whenever they got wet, which I didn't like either. I was so relieved when the natural diapers I ordered to replace these arrived, and I will never use these again!!"
1986,3,Not for tall babies,"My son is 22 pounds but has already outgrown size 4 Pampers diapers in height. Although the description says the diapers are good until 28 pounds. I ordered the next size 5 but in height they are almost identical to size 4, they are just made to accomodate more weight. So we will be switching to Huggies, in Huggies he still fits into size 4 with some room to grow!Meanwhile we used Pampers for 3 months and they were great. Almost no accidents, soft to the touch, smells powdery but not overpowering and price through amazon can not be beat. I just wish they took taller babies into consideration!"
1987,4,Much better than Swaddlers,Baby Dry diapers are much better than Swaddlers. I can't stand the chemical smell of the new Swaddlers (with Dry Max) and didn't want my baby to have to smell it all day. Baby Dry is a good alternative. The adhesive taps are not as secure as Huggies diapers.
1988,1,"""Baby Dry"" but Covered with Poop","After hitting the end of the line with Pampers Swaddlers, which max out in a size 2-3, we figured ""Baby Dry"" was the logical next step. *Every* time our daughter pooped it came right up the back and on to her outfit, her mother, the sofa--you name it. She is right in the size range. We will *not* be buying this diaper again."
1989,2,Not worth it,"I tried these because I used Pampers Swaddlers and Cruisers in the past and liked them (before switching to 7th Generation diapers temporarily because of concerns over my baby's skin sensitivity). The price enticed me to buy these, and I was really disappointed. They felt cheap and the performance was poor. LOTS of leaking, in my opinion. Her sheets and clothes all smelled like urine continuously. I couldn't wait to get rid of them. I bought Cruisers in the same size to replace them, and they were a lot bigger. Just an opinion, but to me I'd rather pay more for diapers that work better."
1990,4,Great deal,Excellent deal from amazon on Pampers diapers. Free shipping. Fast delivery. Will order more in the future.
1991,2,There is a reason for cheaper price,"Baby dry was okay until my daughter's poop got bigger! It leaks! We even have to change her pants and bodysuits everyday. I was very frustrated. Then I changed to Pampers Cruisers with Dry max which is a little bit expensive than this one. It worked perfectly!! No leaking and no washing of clothes any more!! But if your baby is not a big eater as my daughter, baby dry was okay. You just have to change often though."
1992,5,The softest diapers out there with the best fit ever!,These diapers are the best. I cannot say enough about them. In my opinion they are much better than Huggies and fit true to size. I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.
1993,2,Not good for overnight... or even a few hours sometimes,"The price was nice but the performance is lacking. Our son can soak one of these full in a few hours and has more leaks with these. We don't dare use these overnight and just use them during the day (We use Huggies Snug & Dry Size 3 at night). Even during daytime use, he still will leak once in a while with these. It might be partly a sizing issue since these are larger than the equivalent 3 in the Huggies. We won't be getting these again after this pack runs out."
1994,2,Problems with leaks and fastening,"We only used 5 of these diapers with our newborn, and we had problems with 4 of the diapers. Two leaked poop or urine. One had the fastner break. One had the fastener repeatedly detach.We had no problems with Pampers Swaddlers, so we will switch back to that diaper type. Perhaps, this diaper type will work better at the higher size."
1995,1,Disappointed to say the least,"After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!"
1996,5,super great! Never leak for my Little guy.,"I love Pampers. They never leak for us.He leaked out of every other diapers we tried and with Amazon Mom, these are a better price than the store brands anyway."
1997,2,Too Pricey!,"We purchased these for awhile because they were the only diapers that would stand up to the ""blowouts"" but let me tell you the Target brand diapers are the same quality for SOOOO much less $ If I had any advice for people getting Pampers or Huggies it would be try Target brand they are the best I promise you won't be disappointed. Don't try Kroger or Kmart brands or anything similar just Target. Only if someone told us this a year ago we'd have a Ferrari by now with all the money we saved after switching!"
1998,5,Great deal!,This is a great item and is shipped quickly to my house and I never have to worry about going to the store to pick up diapers. Amazon is the best!!
1999,4,Pampers Baby Dry,"I loved the quantity and the feel of the diaper. It's soft and not as bulky as others. Pampers are my favorite. I noticed, however, the Baby Dry ones seemed to leak more up the back and out the legs than the other Pampers products. It is almost like this type was not as absorbant. I think a lot would have been prevented if they had the net on the back to catch if anything goes up the back."
2000,3,smaller than swaddlers,"order the same size from amazon, but this one is a little bit smaller than swaddlers. Swaddlers is softer than this one, too."
2001,1,lumps in the diapers,"i don't know if it's pampers or this particular distributor, but there are what seems to be dried up resins in lumps in the diapers. i wonder if they absorbed moisture then dried. i'll never buy another pampers diaper."
2002,3,Love pampers,"I do love pampers diapers. I was a little disappointed in the baby dry vs the swaddlers. The swaddlers are definitely softer and just fit my babies better. I wish the swaddlers went up in the next size. I will say that these baby dry do work well but they are a tiny bit smaller than the swaddlers in the back. I had a hard time finishing the box b/c of them being smaller. I purchased the next size up the next time and they fit great. I am use to them now and like them. If I had a choice over these and the swaddlers, I would def pick the swaddlers for the softness."
2003,2,contents leaking,I got the replacement because of severe diaper rash which is the first time for my son. I have to say amazon customer is good. They send me new box and I send old ones back.But the new box is even worse. There s Crystal like stuff come out from the diaper. I need wash my son every time.
2004,3,Not very satisfied with Pampers Baby dry size 1 diapers,"I used pampers baby dry size 1 for my 2 months old and I'm not very satisfied with them.They soak the pee ok but you can feel the wetness from outside and they are really badwhen my little on poops,they cannot stand it and it all comes out and she needs a completechange everytime she poops.I really didn't like these much.Pampers swaddlers dry max are byfar the best ones I used."
2005,2,You get what you pay for . . .,"Rather flimsy construction, prone to leaks, with a distinct chemical smell when baby is wet--I wouldn't buy these diapers again."
2006,1,Unacceptable,"We started out with Pampers Swaddlers from newborn to Size 2-3 which is the largest that they make. These were hands down the best diapers we have tried during the first year. After our daughter outgrew the Swaddlers we tried Pampers Cruisers and were a little disappointed, however the Cruisers did their job of keeping everything where it was supposed to be. I saw the reviews for Baby Dry and thought ""hey let's try these and see if they are better than Cruisers"" BIG MISTAKE. We received the diapers yesterday and have already had multiple leaks and overflows. These diapers have almost no absorbency and need to be changed approximately every 2 hours for us. We made the mistake of using it overnight and the entire bed was soaking wet this morning.These diapers may work for some, however I can't believe that they would work for many considering how little they can hold. Buyer beware."
2007,5,Pampers Economy Pack Plus,When my Grandbaby is happy. I'm happy. I've always liked Pampers for many years with my kids and now I'm using them for my Grandbabies. The Pampers Economy Pack Plus is really nice. Why? Because it keeps me from running back to the store which save me gas money and it's also saves me money going with the Economy Pack Plus. Thank you Pampers for being there when we need you. =)
2008,4,Ok For the money,They are good for the money however you can get more for the same price at walmart. I think I will be going with that option from now on.
2009,3,Too thick,"seemed like everytime we went and tried to pull out a wipe, we ended up getting two or three. Honestly the wipes just seemed thicker than what we would need."
2010,2,Not that great,"I wasn't too impressed by these diapers. The diaper itself stays dry overnight and doesn't leak through if the baby just pees. However, these diapers (size 2) seem low on my 14 lb baby (he is on the longer side though) and he had several leaks (pooped out the back and front at the same time on several occasions), honestly, I wondered if I should have gotten a size 3 for him. The size 2 pampers swaddlers are great and the pampers baby dry just don't compare."
2011,1,Watch out---New Design EXPLODES!,"Ever since they've redesigned these, almost every morning, my son is found wet, and the diaper has actually split on the sides with the gel contents spilling everywhere. It's ever so much fun having to clean a toddler, crib, walls, floor, all first thing in the morning. I have used these religiously since the first couple of months, but I've changed brands."
2012,5,excellent,"Amazon is the best place to shop. The price is reasonable and because of the count, it last long. Overall, it is a good buy."
2013,2,Cheaply made.,This is the very cheap product that does not measure up to the standards of the other Pampers diapers. I would recommend not to buy this but the 186 count instead.
2014,2,don't like the quality,"I won't use it again.very low quality. I feel the frequency with which I change these ,adds up the cost.so better to buy a good quality diaper."
2015,2,Leaks all the time,"My bundle of joy is 4.5 mo old and none of the other diapers leaked until I started using this one. I tried other brands, Huggies, Luv and also Pampers Swaddlers and they all work fine except this one."
2016,1,Worst costumer service ever!!!!!!!! size runs small,"My baby isn't 17lbs yet and these diapers were too small for her, and they say it is for 16 to 28 lbs. Plus, even though my baby sleeps through the night , when I used this diaper, she woke up at 2:30am all WEAT. I called the Pampers costumer service and they offered me a $5 coupom...........yes, I could not believe it, at last they offered a $10 coupom, so I'll still need to spend monwy on it? I hopped to have at least a size 4 sent to me. Be carefull, those diapers can work for you, but be concious that whenever you need the costumer service they will not replace the diapers.Not buying Pampers agin........by the way, seventh generation and Huggies are far better!Viviane"
2017,1,Try another diaper!,These diapers have been a huge disappointment! They claim to be Baby Dry but they don't keep anything dry. We've only been using them for a few days and every day we've had to change outfits because of wet diapers. The diaper doesn't even seem to absorb anything. As far as night protection? There's no way it offers 12 hours of protection. Maybe one or two and that's if you're willing to change the sheets.I'm going back to Luvs.
2018,3,Great diaper except for the stains,"We have used Pampers Baby Dry since our daughter was 3 months old. We love this diaper, it keeps our daughter dry throughout the night and doesn't cause any skin irritations. However, since January, every box we have purchased has contained numerous diapers with redish brown stains on them. I'm not sure what the stain is, the company isn't sure but thinks it might just be oil/grease and will look into the problem. Considering it is now May I would think the problem would have been solved by now yet the most recent box we received had several stained diapers. I don't feel comfortable putting stained diapers on my child and therefore, as much as we love Pampers Baby Dry we will possibly have to switch diapers. Diapers are just too expensive to have to toss several due to stains. I expect better from Pampers and I'm disappointed."
2019,5,Pampers Baby Dry - Size 4.,"I've been ordering this pampers size 4 now for about a year. Subscribe and save.Very Good Deal, Item exactly as expected!"
2020,3,"Great product, SLOW shipping!",I held off on buying diapers in the store because I had a coupon for diapers here. The coupon was supposed to have them here in 2 days (from when it shipped out) and it took over a week. Let's just say that I had to improvise while we waited. I'll be going back to the old fashioned method of buying diapers in the store from here on out.
2021,4,Good product... but no more subscribe and save!,"I love these diapers. They work well with my daughter. No leaks here! But I used to buy them on the Subscribe and Save program, and that's no longer available. Now the price at Amazon is just as high as anywhere else. I am upset that it's not a good deal anymore."
2022,5,Great Deal,"This was such an amazing deal! Pampers diapers for below off-brand prices. The box, even though from the warehouse, was in excellent condition and there was no indication that it had ever been opened. Couldn't be happier."
2023,2,A defective pack,"This is the first time I ordered size 5. It was a defective pack. The sides stick to the inside of the diaper when I try to open up the diaper to put it on my child. When I forcibly pull them apart, plastic is left on the area my daughters bum will be, as well as strands of plastic left hanging that I have to be careful to pick off so my child doesn't get them. Hopefully it is just this pack. It still absorbs as Pampers usually do."
2024,5,Pampers dry max,"My 18 months old daughter is prone to diaper rashes. Anything that's a little hard rubs against her sensitive skin and she gets rashes which look like pimples and red, in a few seconds. I tried all the brands- huggies baby dry, luvs, rite-aid brand, Walgreens brand but only pampers dry max worked for her. It absorbs a lot n she is always dry, unless left overnight( more than 8 hrs). Huggies little movers are also good, but none can beat pampers and as for the price with amazon subscribe and save, pampers is cheaper and delivery is fast. I highly recommend this product for babies with sensitive skin."
2025,1,DO NOT BUY if your child has sensitive skin!,"If your child has sensitive skin DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND. Our child suffered for 3 months with total body rash - we thought it was due to food allergies, but it was actually due to the diaper. Pampers use TOO MUCH DYE on the images on the diapers. The dye is totally unnecessary. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, even more so, DON""T SUBJECT YOUR BABY TO unnecessary CHEMICALS and ALLERGENS.TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!!!"
2026,2,I'm switching back to Swaddlers,"I figured for the price I'd give pampers dry a chance and now I'm incredibly disappointed with this product. I'm not exactly why it's called ""Pampers Dry"" since it does a horrible job at absorbing urine. On many occasions I'd have to change my baby's clothes simply because the urine has run up her back and wet her clothes along with my bedsheets.I'm going back to Swaddlers!"
2027,1,go somewhere else,"You can buy these cheaper at the babiesareus store (with mail/email coupons) Product itself is good, I am a pampers brand mom."
2028,3,increible price,"These diapers smell kinda plastic!!! But besides that the diapers function very, very well and has an incredible price. This is great since I just had triplets. Economy pack highly recommended for those with many kids!!!!!!!!!!!"
2029,2,Bad Diapers,"We have been using Pampers Cruisers, I got these by mistake. These are not anywhere near as good as the Cruisers."
2030,4,Like the price & quantity,I bought these diapers mainly because of the price and the quantity. I like them but found they leak often. I prefer Luvs.
2031,2,Not as good as Cruisers,"I normally buy Pampers Cruisers, I will not buy these again. They seem really cheap, plastic like, I don't like the smell. Yuck, can't wait for the jumbo pack to be done!"
2032,4,Minimal graphics,"Of course these are absorbant and highly functional--the industry has that figured out. Of the mainstream affordable disposible diapers, these have the least noticable and annoying graphics. The other kind of Pampers are the worst--covered in purple."
2033,4,Best Daytime Diapers We've Found,"I really like these diapers. They are great at preventing daytime leaks. I would give them five stars, but they don't work well at night. We use Pampers Extra Protection at night instead."
2034,3,Its ok,"Nothing special to report here, was looking for an overnight diaper for my 21 month old, it does an adequate job, only one or two leaks out of the diaper, but that may have been because it was loose or she was in a position where it was apt to leak. Not bad, not the best, but works well enough, maybe there are other brands out there that perform as well for less dollars."
2035,4,Pampers Size 4 Economy Pack,I ordered the Economy Pack of Pampers Baby Dry Size 4 and I LOVE Pampers although the size is a little small for 4 it was very convenient and nice sized!! I will order this product again!!!
2036,1,Not my favorite,We used Pampers sensitive swaddlers for my son but by the time he was size 3 they did not work. The swaddlers didn't have good protection and he would poop out of them. We decided to try baby dry. They are awful every diaper he either pees or poops out of. Now I am constantly washing his clothes and going through at least 3 outfits a day. I am really not happy with Baby Dry. I loved Pampers but a friend of mine told me she had same problem with the larger sizes of Pampers and had to switch to huggies. :(
2037,3,"They work, but not my favorite diaper","I ordered these diapers because there were no more Luvs in size 5 available for my subscribe and save. I have usually liked Pampers in the past, but I was not impressed with these. For a size 5 they were considerably smaller than other brands in a size 5. They have not leaked so far, but they are not comfortable for my son at all and for the price, they should be. I am on baby number four and I do know that different diapers work differently for each person/child, but I am not impressed with these."
2038,1,Horrible,"If we don't change the diaper at least every 3 hours, there is a spill. So every morning when our daughter wakes up we have to wash everything in her bed. The jell in the diapers gets saturated so easily. Some of the jell has actually leaked out and given our daughter a break out on her tummy and legs. Not to mention everything else she has leaked on. The swadlers were the best. I should have just sticked with them."
2039,2,Leaky diapers,When my baby did #2 they always leaked. I switched to pampers swaddlers and they are perfect. I ordered these by mistake to begin with.
2040,5,our favorite diapers,"These are the least bulky, most silky feeling of all the diapers we've tried (and we've tried them all.) My daughter LOVES Elmo and the Sesame Street characters on them, and they are as leakproof as any other brand."
2041,5,Best Diapers EVER!!!!,"In the year we have been using these, my son has never once soaked through. Not even over night. That speaks VOLUMES in this house!!!"
2042,5,Great value! The quality product for the price I wanted!,I purchased these for my sister in law's baby shower and they were a big hit! I made these adorable diapers into a 4 layer diaper cake and had plenty more to spare. I trust the pamper brand name and so I was glad that I was able to give her a functional and yet presentable gift. My family has always bought Pampers and I'm glad we can continue this tradition with the next bundle of joy.
2043,1,Poor quality - new design?,"I am a long-time Pampers buyer and have never had a complaint before, but my latest batch of baby dry must be either defective or a new design. The tabs tear off of the diaper with the tiniest amount of force. Which means as I'm diapering my wiggly baby, I sometimes go through three diapers before I get one on that stays intact. Very frustrating for such an expensive product. Never had this experience with this brand with my older children, so have to assume Pampers is cutting corners."
2044,1,Terrible diaper,I got these diapers because I had a coupon. Big mistake. It felt like it took forever for me to get through this one pack of diapers. I almost threw them out completely. They have hardly ANY tabs on the size so they are too tight on my little one. They are also pretty scratchy and not at all soft.I think the best diapers on the market are the swaddlers made by the same company.
2045,2,Diapers ok...delivery: HORRIBLE,"Diapers are Pampers, so they work as well as any diaper. Except, that I prefer Safeway brand diapers because they hold overnight and are slightly bigger than Pampers. But, the price is comparable to Amazon.com. Delivery, on the other hand was horrible! Box was totally ripped, torn and almost all the diapers were exposed. Deivery by UPS and I took a pic. Very disappointed Amazon didn't put box into another to protect the cheap box the diapers are orginiall packaged in."
2046,2,Exploding diapers,At your peril let your child fill one of these diapers eg during a long overnight sleep or nap... The diapers literally explode and you will find bits of soaked absorbent material all over the place. These are not as absorbent as other leading brands and when they are wet they also feel wet on the outside. I expected so much more from pampers
2047,2,Won't order these again.,We prefer the Swaddlers! Much more roomy - big difference between these and the Swaddlers. We won't order these again!
2048,4,feels squishy with the slightest bit of wetness,"I don't remember the Baby Dry being like this before, but they feel like that dry max stuff. It feels like she's soaking wet and squishy after the tiniest bit of urine hits the diaper. I much prefer the other high cost brand that doesn't cost as much!"
2049,1,PAMPERS BABY DRY ARE TERRIBLE!!!,"Don't buy these!!! I have always used Pampers diapers, and think they are far superior to other brands. Until, that is, I tried these Baby Dry diapers! They leaked like crazy! Not onece or twice, but every time I used them! If I didn't change the baby IMMEDIATELY after them getting wet, it would soak straight through the diaper and wet her clothes! NEVER had a problem like that with the Cruisers...I still have an almost full package of Baby Dry because I got sick of changing clothes constantly from the leaks! I will never buy these again-- only Pampers Cruisers from now on!!!"
2050,1,NOT GOOD,I was shocked at how poor these diapers were for a name brand. My 2 year old would constantly pee through these after being in one for only an hour! The Target diapers and the Huggies work much better for my son.
2051,2,DO NOT last the night,"I bought these based on the reviews and the price. Big mistake. I only get 6 hrs of ""dry"" time before my little one soaks through his clothes and leaves a big wet spot on the bed."
2052,3,Not Bad but I would recommend Earth's Best,"Pros: Cheap,Free Shipping to home directlyCons: Has Chlorine and other Synthetic ugly stuff when compared with other productsMy daughter had a serious Rash, we turned to Earth's Best Organic Chlorine free diapers and It is worth it."
2053,5,Great buy!,I have been getting these diapers since my baby was new born. My son bed stay dry for now all night. The diaper is really heavy by the morning but no concerns of leaks.
2054,1,never buy it again,"use it as not using, the diaper even broke on the side...... never buy it again!!!!! it make skin rash, . babd bad bad !!!"
2055,1,Diapers had strange stain,Some of the diapers in the box had a strange stain on them! Had to throw them out. What a waste. LM for Amazon to provide a refund.
2056,2,Too smelly for me,"Well these diapers are ok as far as soaking capacity goes and I didn't have any problem with leaks. Size is pretty accurate as well.My problem with these diapers is the green color on the inside (that touches baby's skin), with strong chemically smell. We got Pampers at hospital as well, and they had similar smell. But green on these makes them even more unappealing. After having used other brands and cloth diapers for a long time, I just couldn't get past the smell and decided to cancel my subscription."
2057,2,Wanted these to work for my youngest,"I used Pampers Baby Dry for my 2-year-old daughter with no problems. I started my youngest daughter on Swaddlers after she was born and when she started having leaks, we switched to Pampers Baby Dry diapers. They seemed okay at first, but then the leaks started again. She would leak out of the legs and would have blowouts out of the back. It was very frustrating for me. I know that the same diapers don't work for all babies, and this was the case for us! We're now using Target's Up & Up diapers with no issues!"
2058,4,Great deal,"You cannot beat the deal you get on these diapers on Amazon.com! We have had a few problems with overnight leaks, but that was after 7-8 hours of sleep and a large cup of milk or two each time."
2059,3,Pampers Review,These diapers seem to run small. My son is husky but usually wears a size 4 in diapers. The size 4 Pampers barely fit around his stomach. Daytime absorbency is fine since he is changed more frequently during the day. The pampers are not absorbent enough for a night time diaper.
2060,2,Rashes and pee crystals,"This may be a kid specific thing, but little man got a terrible rash shortly after switching to Pampers. AND, diaper tearing - resulting in pee crystals. A HUGE diaper pet peeve of mine. Back to Huggies we go. :("
2061,2,Poop everywhere!,"These diapers are great for pee (never leaks), but terrible for poop (frequently leaks). We've been using these for the past 2 months (my daughter is now 4 .5 months, average size). She is breastfed so her poop is really runny. Even if I literally run to change her as soon as I hear her poop, it still regularly squeezes up and out all over her back and clothes. Most days she messes her clothes at least once. I'm going to try something else because this is just ridiculous (and gross!)."
2062,3,Not as good as swaddlers,The baby dry were not as good as swaddlers in my mind. We have had a lot of blowouts with these and hardy ever had them before. I think the waist doesn't cinch up as much - there is a gap between the diaper and our daughters back. I will switch back to swaddlers after this pack.
2063,3,Pampers Baby Dry,"We have been using the Pampers baby dry diapers for a week now. As far as performance we are pleased. We are not experiencing any leaks and they fit our baby well. However, before I ordered them I kept wondering what was the difference between the baby dry vs. the swaddlers. As far as I can tell, the only difference is that the baby dry does not have the colored line to indicate when the diaper is wet. This feature is a huge plus when you are a new parent."
2064,3,"Okay, but sag like crazy!",My son seems to go through more of these than Huggies or even my beloved Sam's Club brand. They sag really badly and don't hold as much urine. I got a great price on them so they worked for us.
2065,1,"""Baby Wet"" should be the name!","Diapers don't absorb wetness at all, everything goes through clothes! Super thin too! Don't buy it! Waste of money for sure!"
2066,5,The best,My son's skin sensitivity works great with Pampers. A great brand and a great loyalty to the brand has been our families opinion. We will always recommend Pampers.
2067,4,Work for Us!,"Both of my kids (a boy and a girl) have used Pampers from birth. I like the Baby-Dry, they are nicely absorbent and seem to fit well. There was a big jump in size from 5 to 6. The 5s were getting small, the 6s are still quite big and she's been wearing them for about 3 months now. Because they are bigger, they have plenty of room for all the overnight filling."
2068,1,Subscribe n save price increase 16%!,"I recently purchased a case of diapers and noticed that there was a huge increase in the diapers I bought. Nothing has changed, but the list price was ~$43 and increased to $51 within two months! This is a overwhelming increase. I don't know what is going on, but you can see the price comparison between other vendors that the Amazon price is significantly higher than Target or Babies R Us. With subscribe and save, it used to provide excellent savings, but now, I have to reevaluate and perhaps close my subscription! Rethink and check out other vendors!"
2069,2,Diaper rash alert,"A little over a week of use, I noticed a bad diaper rash that rapidly progressed to blisters. They healed when I switched to a different diaper and broke out again when I tried to go back to using this diaper. I'm giving two stars because pampers agreed to refund my money even though I was outside the week window to return them to Amazon and because according to Pampers, this is the same formula they have been using for 20 years, which means they were my favorite diapers for my daughter."
2070,4,Leaves of Grass,"Having read only tid bits, here and there, from Leaves of Grass, I found that it was full of truly unique American poetry. Whitman definitely achieved his goal of becoming a truly innovative poet. The fact that he rarely uses any type of meter, rhyme scheme, or exaggerated rhetorical devices almost says that he has mastered the basic fundamentals of poetry and surpassed his peers. He is so far above the simple and frequently used methods that he must create his own fresh and new style of writing. I found Leaves of Grass to be a lot to grapple with as a high school student, especially his philosophy pertaining to Deism, and yet, it was most intriguing and made me want to simply delve deeper into it. I look forward to completing Leaves of Grass and recommend it to anyone looking for truly original forms of American poetry."
2071,1,Fallen Leaves,"Although he may be as genius as he is, Walt Whitman is just random. His structure and development are atrocious, leaving us in a cloud of confusion. His lists, names, and metaphors can only be described as random thought. And don't even get me started on his comma use. That's how my little sister writes for crying out loud! I mean, don't you remember? You'd get lucky if you found an ""and"" in there somewhere. Granted, he did revolutionize poetry and writing as we know it. However, certain selections for his ever famous Song of Myself show that he can sure describe those bodily actions that he seems to love so much. I can cut him some slack, probably because he's a romantic writer, but his random stringing of words, phrases, and lists do his poetry injustice. Poor Jonathon Edwards would be turning in his grave..."
2072,2,Kindle Edition,"The Kindle edition of this great book is not well formatted, and is thus physically difficult to read. Line breaks appear in the middle of words, not always divided by syllable or in a way that would meet the approval of any author of a manual of style.Having only paid 99 cents for this tome, I can only comment that I suppose I got what I paid for."
2073,5,will certainly outlast Bill & Monica,"Whitman set out, like James Joyce, to define and recreate his nation's literature, and perhaps the nation itself, and to express his wildest ideas, glorying in their contradictions. The amazing thing is that he succeeded. There's so much in this book, I wouldn't know where to begin to say any more, except to suggest that opening pages at random over a long period of time is my preferred method of reading this book."
2074,2,A classic must read,NOT! So many times I have tried to catch up with classics I missed reading when I was younger. I found this almost impossible to wade through. I never finished it.
2075,4,Gripping,"One of the best made-for-TV movies I've seen, gripping from beginning to end. You see the minute-by-minute unfolding of an atomic disaster just as it is reported in a live TV news broadcast. Unlike other TV movies that try to emulate theatrical films, ""Special Bulletin"", due to the way it is presented, is truly made to be seen on TV for greatest impact."
2076,4,It's deja-vu all over again!,"I saw this movie when it was broadcast 24 years ago, and have never forgotten it. Although I never mistook it for an actual broadcast of a terroristic event (comparisons to Orson Wells' War of the Worlds notwithstanding), the realism and plausibility of the story were truly frightening. Some of you may remember the commotion caused by the 1979 movie ""The China Syndrome,"" about the cover-up of a nuclear accident. That film was released just weeks before the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. Just as then, I had a palpable sense of deja-vu when I saw ""Special Bulletin,"" and 24 years later, when terror struck in New York City on 9/11, I was just 40 blocks away, and I thought ""it's finally happening."" Watch this movie - given today's political climate, it will scare the socks off you."
2077,4,A vital piece of the New Mexico fiction reads,"The Bradford books, Red Sky at Morning and So Far From Heaven are two tomes slightly before their times. When most of the New Mexico fiction enthusiasts discovered Hillerman and Nichols these two had already gone into decline and were settling into obscurity. Each is well worth pulling from the bottom of the heap, dusting carefully and settling down for a great read.Red Sky at Morning would fit well into the John Nichols collection insofar as insight, humor and good story-telling. The characterization is great in both Bradford books; the plotting is excellent; the penetrating insights into a New Mexico forever in transition between a colorful past, chaotic present and incomprehensible future are all conveyed here.Whether the reader wishes to know New Mexico or simply to spend the evening in smiles and laughs, Bradford will provide."
2078,1,Only if you like flying people,"I gave 1 star for Jet li, cause he is my favorite, but a guy in a boulder shooting him with lightning? Come'on, this movie is bad, Jet li is the man and Chingmy Yau is hot!, but this movie was just bad, too much flying. i dont know what these people are thinking giving it 5 stars, NO WAY not even close, see fist of legend thats 5 stars!"
2079,1,Disgusting and poorly written,"Trick or Treat sounded like a great book from the blurb on the cover, What I found was vile and disgusting. I kept reading thinking it must get better. But no. It never got better. What I found was that the ending proved how really poorly written this book is--the author had multiple threads going. At the end, she dealt with none of them and ended on an improbability that only left more improbabilities. This is the only book I've ever consigned straight to the trash."
2080,1,"battery replacement, wtf?","For those of you that haven't bought Polar, be forewarned that in order to replace the batteries, in either the watch or band, you will have to ship the device back to Polar.You cannot replace it yourself. You cannot go to a watch shop and have it replaced. You MUST send it to Polar.This process will cost you around $50 and you will have to go without your watch for several weeks.Since you can buy a Timex with similar functionality for around $60 and replace the battery yourself, or go to any local watch repair store, I highly suggest you go with something less stupidly designed."
2081,5,You can make it learn to sew 2 dvd,This is the 2nd in the series and is great! I have watched it twice and so far bigin to sew a couple of things. I do very much recommend this series to any one wanting to learn to sew. It is FANTASTIC!!!!!!!
2082,1,Elizabeth Hurley topless is all this movie has going for it.,"The only reason why I think this ""movie"" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet."
2083,4,"A strange film with a weird plot, but I LIKED IT!!!","Jurgen Prochnow, Patsy Kensit, and Elizabeth Hurley are well-cast in this odd little movie about two good-looking bar girls looking for a way to get to the Bahamas from their current home in Gibraltar. Jurgen Prochnow is the quiet drunk who offers them a lift in his boat/yacht. At first I thought he was the luckiest guy in the world, to have two such beautiful women all to himself for a couple of weeks at sea, and in the beginning it seems to live up to its potential. Needless to say, things get worse. I liked a lot of things about this film --- like the musical number the girls perform together for the crowd at the club in Gibralter. They were HOT! Anyway, it's not a GREAT film, but I still liked it!"
2084,1,Worst racing game ever?,"This game is incredibly bad. I really can't stress that enough. It has aspirations of being fantastic and some of the obvious ideas expressed in it are great, but to say that they fail in meeting their goal would be a vast understatement. The game is virutally unplayable out of the box and requires you to download at least three (thus far) giant patches that still don't fix everything. I have a high-end computer that more than doubles the recommended requirements of this game and it still runs terribly. At the price, it's still a horrible investment."
2085,4,Mystery of the Flying Express,"When I started reading it, it was hard to understand. The author didn't give very much information at the beginning of the book. After I read a few chapters I understood it. This isn't my favorite Hardy Boy book, but it has plenty of action, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. If you are a Hardy Boy fan you will find it anything but boring."
2086,1,So very odd...,"I bought this book because of the good review I read in 'Preview' and was really kind of confused when I actually sat down and read it. I have never read anything like it, the whole set up and style was foriegn to me. I found the story itself pretty depressing. At least the parts of it I understood. I can see how some people would consider it deep and moving, but when I finished it I just felt like I had been tricked out of fourteen bucks. Read the first few pages of the preview on this site, it gives you a pretty good idea of the tone of the book. Wish that I had done that."
2087,5,Excellent.,"Jason, Hey, Wait... (Fantagraphics, 2001)Graphic novel artist Jason made a huge splash with this slim volume when it first came out a few years back. It's pretty easy to see why; with a minimum of dialogue and a ot of abstraction, Jason paints a deeply affecting pastiche.The story concerns two childhood friends who decide to start a fan club. While they're planning out the initiation, something goes horribly wrong, and the rest of the book deals with one friend's lifelong reaction to a life-changing event.Hey, Wait... is unflinching. If you haven't yet come to the world of graphic novels, this is a great place to start; even the toughest critics of graphic novels, I should think, would be hard-pressed to deny the emotional power of this little tale (and it certainly puts to bed the idea that all comics are for kids). ****"
2088,4,Clever and simple,"Jason's comic coming-of-age story has many gems. His simplistic style and steady pacing with the use of the same comic panels on every page forge a universe made of a very personal visual language. The lines between adulthood and childhood are clearly drawn (so to speak): adults are tired, working-class that rarely smile as they tread the streets on stilts; the two kids in the story have boundless imagination and their world is populated by undead bullies and comic monsters.The second part does not read as cleverly as the first, though done with the same care. The symbolism of the first half is only seen when the main character hits his lowest ebb. Its not clear why this character is made to suffer so much as his guilt succumbs to an unsatisfying life. Jason's very linear narrative could have used a little more complexity on this end but is otherwise a work that strikes a dark chord in regards to lost innocence and lost life and the parallels between the two."
2089,3,Uumm new info,Well I didn't find much interest in this book but I did learn lots of new things from it. Each chapter kind of contains the same info as another chapter which is why I felt like I was reading things over n over
2090,4,Great text...,"wish I had a better professor teaching the material. This is a great primer to the history of charity and philanthropy. I used it as a text for a Masters level course. The book taught me more than its presentation in the course, but... it happens..."
2091,4,"For Shoes,waders,bike tires","This stuff can extend the life of a pair of shoes, waders, rain gear, or a punctured bike tire, my most frequent applications. For shoe soles, has worked best for me to apply several thin coats, allowing complete drying/hardening between coats--does not peel off quite so quickly as one thick layer which tends to get scuffed off all at once. Reliable patch adhesive & hole filler for patching bike tubes and leaky waders--works better than the rubber cement typically supplied with a patch kit. Agree with other reviewers that it's better to buy several smaller tubes, as it does dry out in the full-size tube faster than I can use it. Trick to removing from your hands or other places you do not want it is to rub with petroleum jelly (e.g. Vaseline) BEFORE it dries--should easily, quickly dissolve it."
2092,4,Not Quite as Good as Aquaseal,"I use this mainly for repairing my fen boots. The surface needs to well roughened and clean for it to stick well. It shouldn't make a difference but the black version of this seems to have worked better than this clear version for me. It is thicker than Aquaseal so it doesn't go into as small crevices but it is cheaper and can be used when there is a wide gap between the surfaces, like for reattaching soles."
2093,5,A Very Useful Product!,"Shoe Goo is great on soles of sneakers.I used to go through at least two pairs of sneakers in a year, but with Shoe Goo, I have been able to get at least a year (and often, more than that).I highly recommnend this fine product."
2094,2,doesn't work as promised,"Tried to repair shoes that were pulling away from the soles...directions said to apply lots of glue, so I did. Once it dried, it made the shoes very heavy...so much so that I don't like to wear them anymore. It did seem to hold the soles back together pretty well, but again, made the shoes very heavy."
2095,5,I use it for more than just shoes,"This is one tough glue. I have used it to fix rips in bicycle seats. Glue the rubber feet back to the base of items ect. I have had the same tube for years and I have used it on every gluing need I have had and it has performed beyond my expectations. It may not fix every shoe problem you may have but shoes take serious amount of twisting and flexing. The fact that this glue will hold the way that it does is worth having around. That is my opinion I hope you find it as useful as I have.Good luck,Matthew"
2096,5,Great stuff!,"I had 2 pair of my favorite shoes come apart within a month. I did some research on line on what I could repair them with and found shoo goo. I glued them both ""back to health"" and have worn them several times since. At first I took an extra pair of shoes with me just in case the sole came loose again but that never happened. I love this product. I'm planning on buying the clear as well to use on my tennis shoes."
2097,4,Very pretty,"I actually liked it very much and bought it in all three colors --peridot, amethyst and topaz. They very clearly state 3mm, hence I did not expect it to be big. The setting is more prominent than I would like but pretty all the same and seems secure."
2098,1,DON'T LET THE TITLE OF THIS FILM MISLEAD YOU.......,"If you are looking for the Audrey Hepburn Story, then this is most definately not the place. While the film is whimsical and pretty to look at, a documentary film or biography on the late actress would be far more capable of telling the story. The title role was horribly miscast, and while Ms. Hewitt tries very hard, she lacks the age, grace and wisdom to conquer such a role. I was very dissapointed in the picture, especially at the fact that they dedicated three hours to such a small portion of Audrey Hepburn's life and only ten seconds to her work with UNICEF (the best ten seconds of the film). While Hewitt fans are sure to enjoy her in a role that was very obviously tailored for her, I urge people in search of the ""real"" Audrey Hepburn to look elsewhere."
2099,4,Stunning,"Although Audrey Hepburn can not be compared to anyone, I feel that Jennifer Love Hewitt demonstrated Audrey's sweetness and innoncence very well. It is soo easy to understand how so many of us love Audrey, her charm and smile. I really enjoyed the way the movie was set up and I loved the costumes."
2100,1,Hewitt is horrible. Story is inaccurate! The list goes on.,"First, I will give Jennifer Love Hewitt some credit... She did a wonderful job at slaughtering the story of a true film icon. But then, what do you expect from the co-executive producer who just happened to cast herself in the lead? Hewitt makes no secret that she's an Audrey wanna-be, and this movie just shows how hard she'll try (and how much money she'll spend) to be Audrey.I agree 100% with the reviewer that mentioned she would have rather seen a ""documentary style special."" So much of the 'Audrey Hepburn Story' is not even accurate and I think its a shame! Get the real Audrey story from RELIABLE sources... like A&E's biography or Lifetime's Intimate Portrait!"
2101,2,a travesty,"This film did nothing to portray Audrey in the best light possible. sub-par acting (Natalie Portman was the obvious choice!!!), and the directing was 'off.' Also, that ""moon river"" crooning had to be a JOKE! Buy or rent one of Audrey's REAL films, and you'll be much better off."
2102,4,Great find!,"I picked this up after seeing a review in Pitchfork, and what an excellent find this is! In some of his neosoul songs I hear Cody Chestnutt, Martin Luther, Bill Withers, and even Anthony Hamilton on a ""Change Goin to Come."" He astutely covers a range of styles from latin and hip hop to R&B. The carribean flavor of a couple of the songs surprised me - I'd never heard of an artist intermingling neosoul with latin, but Blacc pulls this feat off with aplomb ease. Not all the songs are consistent throughout, but his beautiful vocals and fine production make this a superb first effort. I really like the song where he is singing about waiting for a bus at the bus stop. This song really displays the honesty and spontaneity of his artistry. Highly recommended!"
2103,3,Average Attempt,"I enjoy reading John Douglas's books; I have always found his insights interesting. This book is not up to par with some of his other works, however. Perhaps it is because these are cases that remain unsolved and much that he would use in ""working cases"" has been muddied by years of mystery. Perhaps the best thing he says is that all killings deserve equality in the press -- that the press shouldn't single some cases out because of some sensational in the case, whether it be the brutality or the wealth of the family. Everyone deserves for their suffering to receive equal attention."
2104,1,Misleading rhetoric from self adulating Douglas,"Typical Douglas, in his self aggrandizing style, makes himself the authority on all crime related topics. If Douglas could downsize his ego, it would make it easier to read. For example, despite what the police, the state, and even his former colleagues in the FBI considered about the Ramsey case, Douglas ""alone"" has it solved -- i.e. the parents, from whom he took a substantial sum of money for his ""consultation"", are innocent. Incredible that Douglas makes such a conclusion, even though he wasnt privvy to the evidence, as the FBI was and who came to a markedly different conclusion about the parents' involvement.A waste of time to read this book. I have to agree with McCrary and Ressler, two greatly respected FBI profilers, that Douglas has gone Hollywood."
2105,3,Not bad...could have been better,"I read a previous book by John Douglas and was fascinated by the science of profiling. As a result, I also enjoyed this book. I believe the book could have been improved by not including the Lizzy Border case; the Bembenek story; and the Black Dahlia case, none of which many Americans are really familiar with. Douglas could have included theories about the more reknown cases such as the Green River Killer and the OJ Simpson case. The book is certainly worth a read if you enjoy the true crime genre."
2106,2,Pretty much useless,"Generally, it and its wall wart just adds useless clutter. Doesn't hold much charge (might double the life of the average cell phone). Three or four times as large and heavy as the average cell phone. Not much in the way of uses: most of the time, you're going to be near an electric socket, a usb port or a car's cigarette lighter recepticle, so might as well just get the appropriate wires."
2107,3,Battery Backup,"I bought this as a battery backup for my MP3 player. I use it to listen to audio books on airline flights. It does the job fine, but I feel it is overly heavy for the job and has features, like an AC output, which I really don't need. My only real gripe is that it takes a very long time to recharge."
2108,2,"Charges on the cheap, or not","It's a little bigger and bulkier than an SNES game cartridge. It's about the weight of a shoe. I tested it on my Zune 30 and my friend's iTouch 8gb. It didn't charge the iTouch at all, so don't count on that. It charged my Zune, but took pretty much two of these using the USB charging outlet to charge it from completely empty (non-functioning) to completely full (green battery icon). I plugged in my Zune AC wall charger into the pocket power AC outlet and had a little more success. It didn't quite take two. It didn't charge my laptop.I gave it two stars based on the Amazon price. I got two for $15, and would give it three based on that. I guess I can only recommend this if you find two really cheap and you have a Zune."
2109,2,battery backup time,i needed a battery back up just in case if i am unable to plug in my wall charger. i tested this unit several times after fully charging the back up unit and it will charge my cell phone for 20 minutes and then it will run out of energy.the price dropped dramatically here on amazon so i am guessing it is being discontinued or it is on clearance.i am going to look for another back up unit
2110,5,When you're tired of Vegas,"As a three going on four year resdient of the Silver State, I highly recommend this book for even short term visitors who want to see something more than the Vegas strip. There's more to Nevada than casinos - beautiful desert vistas and some really offbeat places, like Area 51, are a welcome break from the neon."
2111,4,Great R&B song,"I first heard it on TV - the video. I wasn't actually watching it but the (as the previous reviewer mentioned) sythesized bass caught my attention. I buy almost only club music/mixes from shops like perfectbeat or beatport, but this song sounded special. For me it has great catchy beat, is dark, sexy vocals (and the vocalist!), great video that is different from all other videos like Beyonce's Deja Vu (her worst video ever). The song is Dark & Sexy. What else do you need?"
2112,1,"Cassie is good eye-candy,but wack musically","this song is ok nothing special. vocally ain't much to Cassie,but the Lyrics&overall vibe make this song work."
2113,1,Seemed like a good concept...,"First off, let me say that I have been braiding hair for two decades and although I am not a licensed professional, I think I would definitely qualify as an experienced braid technician, or whatever you wish to call it. I bought this product because I thought, ""Wow! This is pretty cool! It might spare the tips of my fingers from being burned"". Well, I was wrong. It doesn't ""cut"" the braid as described. It burns off the bottom portion and creates a finished look that is quite tacky considering that you have to clamp down on the braid longer than you might expect just to ""cut"" it. I ended up using my lighter. Whoever designed this should get back to the drawing board. Do not buy this product unless you want the end of your braids to look like a big flat piece of melted plastic. To give this item one star is giving it way too much credit."
2114,5,Bridesmaid Dresses - great value for the money,"I purchased 4 of these dresses in black. One extra small for my 12 yr old daughter(12/14 in girls), a small for my 14 yr old daughter (1/2 in ladies) and 2 larges for other bridal party members (8-10 in ladies). The dresses pretty much fit everyone perfectly. I am having all hemmed, but my 14yr old who is 5'5"" and the dress falls right below the knee on her, the other ladies are shorter and the dress fell mid-calf. We were very pleased with the dresses. Quality was consistent throughout all the dresses, material a little thin, but for the cost of the dress it was acceptable. I was very pleased and everyone looks great!! Getting married October 2nd, 2010 - can't wait. I was a little nervous with all the reviews being all over the place regarding sizing, quality, etc. I recommend these dresses. Also, they came very fast!"
2115,1,TERRIBLE,"This dress adds 100 lbs, i swear. It is a good price, but you would look better naked. It is unfortunate, but please save yourself and do not purchase this dress."
2116,4,Bridesmaid Dress,Dress was exactly as described. The fit was true to size. Perfect color. The dress is just what we needed for a perfect bridesmaid dress.
2117,3,frustrated,"I like this dress and its affordable price. However, when I ordered the size according to the measurements, it was much too big for me. I sent it back for an exchange in the manner they said to do. However, they didn't send me an exchange, they just gave me a refund. By the time I realized what had happened, I had to pay $20 for expedited shipping in order to make sure I get it in time for my friend's wedding."
2118,4,Great dress,"I love this dress. I ordered this dress at the last minute and it was delievered in due time. I even had a few days to spare before my big event and had the dress altered. Since I am a big girl, I ordered a 3X and it fit very well. I received ALOT of compliments. The material is strong. I personally think it's worth the time and money. The color I ordered was black."
2119,3,Alright,Not really crazy about purple but I was a bridesmaid....sized a little smaller than most clothing.
2120,3,"Love it, but the sizing is way strange","As soon as I saw this dress I had to have it..it's all retro hotness, so I thought it would be perfect for dinner parties and such. It arrived and I've worn it only once. The bust portion is WAY big (I'm a 36C and usually have the reverse problem with dresses) and the waist is a little tight (I'm a size 14). This was my first strapless dress, so I felt a little self-concious with the loose bust enough as it was. I think I could deal with it if it came with straps."
2121,5,Very Very Pleased!,"Was hesitant to purchase because of the price. I was not expecting such quality for the price. I am very very pleased with the fit. It came with a matching shawl and satin straps that I can attach to the dress myself, which I thought was nice because I don't really feel comfortable wearing strapless dresses. I actually ordered two other styles of dresses from this company when I purchased this one to make sure I had a dress suitable to wear for my occasion. I was pleasantly pleased with all of them. They all fit well. I purchased Mediums (my measurements are 34-29-41, pear-shaped) and this dress flatters my figure. I will be purchasing others. I found that the dresses fit according to the sizing chart that is one of the pictures shown."
2122,2,"What was this about, really?","Planning a trip to both of these wonderful places and was tickled to see a book with both in the title. Unfortunately, the book was just strange ramblings and I never could find a point."
2123,3,OK but not quite there,"This book addresses 2 topics, both digital photography and Photoshop Elements 3, doing an average job of each. It's reasonably easy to read, but doesn't quite work for me. I was most keen on the PSE3 section and found the flow odd .... I would have thought after the intro about accessing photos, basic editing would have followed. No, instead there is discussion around line drawings and adding text etc, not closely related to photography.As most photos are black & white and printed on average quality paper, it is sometimes difficult to appreciate what is happening when following editing of photos.I was disappointed that it doesn't discuss basic editing of RAW files, nor does it really discuss workflowsOverall, an easy read and an OK/good intro book, not quite hitting the mark"
2124,5,A Thousand Years of History in one concise book,"Ostrogorsky's History of the Byzantine State is an excellent book for the scholar, as well as the interested reader to use for any understanding of the history of the Byzantine Empire. Well written, concise, and thoroughly interesting, Ostrogorsky depicts the transition of a multi-cultural Late Roman Empire, to a smaller but more centralized and powerful Byzantine State, that became the cultural Renaissance for Eastern Europe and the Near East. Anyone wishing to expand his/her knowledge on this important time in history will not be disappointed to read this work"
2125,5,Fantastic work,Recommended for anyone serious about understanding the Byzantine Empire in depth. A richly detailed examination of of both the topic and its historiography.
2126,4,Can be a migraine trigger,"Very talky, lots of fun, and a tour de force for both Olivier and Caine. In fact it's overload for some viewers, i.e. if your idea of a great film isn't a dialog between just two characters for 2+ hours, you'll likely hate this movie. Personally, while watching ""Sleuth"", I kept expecting Jon Lovitz to pop out of a closet and yell, ""ACTING!""If a few of the props in ""Sleuth"" look strangely familiar, they're from original ""Twilight Zone"" episodes."
2127,5,Masterpiece of suspense and wit.,"Two great stars of the 20th Century combine in this classic whodunnit which might more correctly be termed a who-exactly-done-what-to-whom-and-when? Stage and screen legend, Laurence Olivier, and Michael Caine perform an intricate pas de deu which at all times engrosses while being witty as well as devilishly clever. Highly recommended viewing."
2128,4,Not about content but presentation,"I am writing this review having not seen this film but having just bought it. I wanted to warn anybody potential buyers that this version of Sleuth is flawed. It claims to be a Widescreen presentation, but the credits clearly run off the side of the screen. Also, the label of the film looks like really questionable as if someone printed out labels on their computer and slapped them on the tape. There is not even a running time on the actual tape. Although people who do not like Widescreen probably will not mind, those that do like widescreen will be rather annoyed by this false advertising. The image is a little wider than the standard format, but not wide enough. And it is so blatant. At least make it less obvious! But oh well. I hope the film is good."
2129,5,Worth the Trouble,"This is one of the hardest books of Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's to find in some areas, but it is worth any trouble you have to go to find it. It's a gorgeous tale bringing together many of the popular characters from Yarbro's vampire novels--Saint Germain, Rogerian, Aumtehotep and Olivia. The attention to Roman history tied in with the personal stories of the characters is some of the most skillful writing I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I fully intend to recommend this novel and its fellows to my historical fiction professor. If you have an opportunity to read this book, then grab it. You'll be grateful for it."
2130,4,"Sensual, compassionate historical vampire romance","Ms. Yarbro takes St. Germaine to the ancient world of the Roman Circus and the cruelties that men can to in the name of power and entertainment. Germaine is far more compassionate and kind than most of the so called normal humans. His great love and respect for life cost him dearly, but also allow him to meet a great love for all time"
2131,2,5 stars for content; 2 stars for the format,"Avoid any edition from bnpublishing -- this is the second I have unsuspectingly bought and both are laid out exceptionally poorly, to the point that they are difficult to read.I think this book was taken from an ASCII text file in the public domain, copied and pasted into Microsoft Word, then printed. It is that amateurish.If you can get past the hard-to-read format (weird line breaks, missing paragraph indentations, typos, etc.) this book will change your life."
2132,4,Great Buy,I brought this product for my nephew to wear at my wedding. They look great with his black suit. After trying on the shoes my sister turned around and brought her son more footwear from amazon.
2133,3,nice shoe but laces are cheap,"These shoes are very nice and my son wears them every week on Saturday, but the laces came apart after about a month's worth of wearing. I guess I kind of expected better."
2134,2,Experience notes are missing to be practical,"Apart from the first few pages I lost the author as observations based on experience was put to an end. The remaining chapters are based on mechanics of Spells. Conclusions drawn from observations is far greater in value than mechanics with no real experience notes as to what worked or what failed or how should the performer be feeling when all is going right and when it is out of sync. See works of Joseph C. Lisiewski, Ph.D. on Time and Flow and practicality to a reader in day to day work processing. This work Moon Spells misses this value to end user who wants to Do, Observe, Correct and again Do, Observe, Correct processes in his or her efforts to make a better quality of life."
2135,3,My review of the Last Days of Patton,"I recently purchased a copy of THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON. I was a fan of George C Scott and his works since a I saw Patton some years ago and I was pleased by Scott's reprised role of OL BLOOD & GUTS the movie goes into detail about the months after Germany surrenders and the US rebuilding of Germany. The movie is a source of information, but when Patton is involved in a fatal car wreck the movie goes down hill, because all u c is Patton layin a bed for a 1 and a half havin flashbacks of him during his youth, it is one of the longest deaths scenes in history"
2136,4,good follow up,"this movie is not a academy award winner, but documents the life after the war in germany, and general patton's need tostill be a effective leader even with the buracey of post ar germany.this movie fill's in the gap's after the opriginal 1970movie. the dvd is a decent version, but needs to becleaned upa bit."
2137,1,Movie Quit in middle and wouldn't reload.,Watched movie till halfway point and then just quit playing. Tried several times with no success and even moved to a different machine. Only paid $ 5 so I should have suspected something. Not worth the effort to mail back to seller.
2138,5,DVD and Product Review,"The ""must have"" companion to ""Patton."" George C. Scott reprises his role with the same insight and depth of portrayal that won him the Oscar for ""Patton."" The DVD version is excellent, and arrived exactly when promised."
2139,4,A great conclusion to PATTON!,"I enjoyed learning about the ending of Patton the man. Not as fast paced as Patton but really entertaining. We feel pitty for this warrior of a man in his unfortunate condition. I enjoyed the emotions drawn from his desire to remain the leader in charge, of a situation which he has no control. You'll enjoy this ending saga of a leader who will be a forever part of world history."
2140,4,A personal voyage through India's railways,"The author is a Brit who has lived in India for a long time. He has written a number of books on travels to various parts of India,most of them covering train journeys to some extent. This book may be considered as a series of somewhat unconnected essays about different aspects of the Indian railways. He has a keen eye for observation of the nuances of life in India. This is not a travel guide, but a good account of various things which would be of interest to the railfan or anyone who is interested in knowing more about India and its trains."
2141,3,This book was okay,"This book was okay, but there were a couple of things I didn't like. There were a couple of questions that the writer didn't answer, like what happened to Travis and Priscilla. Those are some loose ends that were not tied up. I did like the ending. I would think this book is for kids ages eight and up. There are some things that are hard to understand, and there are no pictures. I liked that there was a map in the front that tells where everything in the story is located. I would recommend this book for people that like chapter books and for people that want to learn about Florida."
2142,4,look good,cant wait to put some pictures on them saw on pinterest to mod podge a pic on it to make it look like its canvas and good price!!
2143,3,House of Madness,"Flawed but interesting retelling of the classic Poe tale. Oliver Reed gives a very good performance as the ailing Roderick Usher and Donald Pleasence is wonderful as his insane older brother Walter. The sets are also well done. Only a few elements of Poe's tale remains and the ending is pretty lousy, but overall it is an entertaining,well paced, and somewhat bizarre gothic horror film."
2144,4,"Content=Fabulous, Format=Tedious","The recipes are delicious, and directions are thorough, as other readers have noted. I have owned this book for several years, and have one complaint. No recipe is all on one page or even consecutive pages. Once you find what you want to make, you have to flip back to the pastry part of the recipe. Then you have to find the cooking directions for the pastry. Then you flip back to the item you want to bake. Sometimes, in the course of that recipe, it says to use a particular technique and refers to another page. I made a pecan tart with wonderful results (and many compliments), but had to find information in no fewer than four different parts of the book to accomplish this. This book is only for people who are very good readers who follow directions well and are not easily discouraged."
2145,5,another wonderful guide to baking,"Rose has created yet another essential guide to the world of baking. My only concern is that it might take her another ten years to put out her next masterpiece. She is, as usual, concise, clear, and oblivious to calorie counting, so you can be assured of turning out desserts that your family and guests will swoon over without having had to attend culinary arts schools around the world. For those of you who have and enjoy her Cake Bible, ponder this a moment: Rose relates to us that, while she likes cake, she's really a pie person--can you imagine to extra effort that went into this book? How can you resist?"
2146,1,don't waste your money,I love pie but not this book. I have been consistently disappointed with the seven recipes I have made from this book. I followed the directions carefully but a crust that the author raves about as her favorite was dry and crumbly and lacked flavor. Several fillings were similarly lacking in flavor. Author admits a bias against fillings she deems overly sweet but her versions seemed bland to me and to my tasters. I understand tastes differ but I have not found one recipe in this book that I would make again.
2147,5,The Illustrations rule!!!!!!,I loved this book for my kid. He thought the pictures were great. The are so colorful and lively. He is four and just loves all the baseball stuff. The story is pretty good too. I am going to buy this book for all my neices and nephews cause i am sure they will love it too. BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!
2148,1,not the right fit,"This belt was not the right fit, we used the letters and numbers off the belt to place the order.... but still would not fit it was too big."
2149,5,Masterpiece,"I've just started exploring jazz and this is definately the best album I've bought so far. With this album, John Coltrane takes you on a journey. It's as if you're watching a movie. A real masterpiece, which you can listen over and over and over..."
2150,2,A BORE SUPREME...A BORE SUPREME...,"I bought this CD. I listened to this CD. And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum. I get jazz. I love jazz. I ""get"" spiritual jazz. This music is a load of crap. It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity. That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make. Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype."
2151,4,Great but not his best,I know that everyone insists this is the mother of all Coltrane albums. Don't get me wrong it's a fine piece of work. I just don't see the rainbows and stars shooting out of the cd player when it is on.
2152,5,"Guaranteed to stir even ""non-religious"" types","I usually ignore the ""religious"" or ""sacred"" tag in a piece of music and find that I still can fully appreciate the pure musical beauty of it. This album could easily be enjoyed in a similar vein for its sheer passion and energy. (religious or otherwise). So even if you are turned-off by these this ""spiritual"" hype surrounding this landmark album go ahead and buy it! Like Miles Davis's ""Kind of Blue"", the hype is more than justified."
2153,5,Like Coltrane,My friend is in search of his interpretation of God. So I gave this cd to him to help him on his quest. I hope he finds what he is looking for. <3
2154,2,"Same movie as ""Lassie"".","I am little disappointed about this is. This is the exact same movie as ""Lassie"" I bought in November - just different cover.I love the movie but I am disappointed about the ""misleading marketing trick"". That's why I only gave it a 2 stars."
2155,5,Great Product,This black silicon cover fits my Treo Palm without a problem. I use it since the first day I got it. Great Product.
2156,2,Doesn't close properly,"This case does provide some protection for my Palm, but it doesn't close well or stay closed... I've ended up using it with a rubberband around it."
2157,2,Phone Cover,"Not the greatest produce. I have used the product for about 3 weeks and just recently took it off. The cover fits nicely except for the holes on the side which I had to cut bigger. It attracts lots of lint from your pockets. I just haven't really been pleased with it. But for as cheap that it was, I shouldn't really complain."
2158,3,Not as good as the last release (On Your Side),"His voice is still as good but the album is nowhere near as engaging as his earlier release ""On Your Side."" I would not purchase this one again if I had the choice. I'm going to have to look and see what the difference were in terms of the production crew because I can't find any other way to account for the lackluster feel of this CD."
2159,4,You should get this album,"""An Irish Christmas"" is Moya's 6th album and was released last year in the UK. This CD is a beautiful listening experience for Christmas in Moya's signature sound. Many will know Moya as the first lady of Celtic music, the voice of Clannad and older sister to Enya. ""An Irish Christmas"" is a collection of Christmas carols celebrating Moya's beliefs in the Nativity. The good thing about this CD is that there are two songs added that where not included on the UK release but the bad thing is Moya's two original songs from the UK release where not included on this CD. My favorite song from this CD is ""Carol Of The Bells"" which is perfect for Moya's haunting vocal style. Her song ""Oiche Chin"" Galic for ""Silent Night"" is sure to be a hit as her two children sing with her on it. This CD brought a touch of Ireland to my home last year with the UK release and I am sure will this year with this release."
2160,5,the most sexist cookbook ever written,"My mom bought this for me when I went to college. She felt that it might help in preparing quick, cheap meals. While the book does detail some decent recipes and contains some basic tips for the novice cook, it also provides instructions of a different type, that of cooking up some romantic love. The main theme of the book is that if the co-ed cannot cook, then she cannot catch and keep a man. The book is damn funny with chapters titled such as ""Day Dreams Do Come True"", ""Men Love Meat"", and my favorite chapter ""Is He a Fisherman?"". If you want to learn to cook or to make cheap meals, skip this book, but if you want to laugh your ass off, don't miss this one."
2161,5,Title Grossly Understated,"This is the book I was looking for in Highschool, but never found, it not having been written yet. So, I started writing it myself. I am still writing, and then a friend points out its existence. Better than mine, and as if a commentary on mine. Excellent work. Only those who have spent a large portion of their lifetime asking the right questions will realize this book has many of the right answers, and, expressed very succinctly. what I took 20,000 pages and 20 years to find, he condenses beautifully to his first 100 pages. Awesome. Sublime. Profound. Genius unrecognized as such in his own time. If you think it is too long, you have no idea how short it is; you are too immature for the subject and should indeed go with your gut feeling and not bother to read it and go watch Paris Hilton or The Jonas Brothers; such greatness you are not worthy of."
2162,5,Will read again,"I finished this book the other day and as soon as I digest it a bit, I will read it again. To me this is a very important book.For someone interested in witchcraft and shamanism this is essential reading."
2163,3,Short short and short!,I bought these pants for my boyfriend's Bday and when he put them on they looked like clam diggers.... at a normal height of 6'1 they sat above his ankles!!! I have requested a return but no one from the company has even contacted me to find out why or ask if they can fix it in anyway. Not impressed.
2164,5,Classic Silk ~ Classic Quality!,"This ""Classic Silk"" pant has a classic-style design and quality of a bygone era. Combine this dense and durable authentic silk pant with a sport-knit top, smoking jacket and a pair of crocodile slippers...and you'll give even Hugh Hefner a run for his money. Honey-bunnies just can't resist a man in classic, luxurious silk! Live long and lounge well..."
2165,5,Very comfy,"These sleep pants are really comfy, fit perfectly, and look pretty good, too! They are definately real silk, and while I could do without the pockets, I love sleeping in them."
2166,5,great story,"Stirling was a ne'er do well who irritated other officers. He created the SAS out of nothing, and used cast off equipment, to harry Rommel's Afrika Korps with very few people. At one point, a general proposed to give him a Distinguished Flying Cross, because he destroyed over 250 German planes, with far less expenditure than any other branch. He made a lot of mistakes, early on- like Geronimo- but he persevered. Fascinating story.Geronimo: The True Story of America's Most Ferocious Warrioris a comparable, as isPopski's Private Army (Cassell Military Paperbacks)."
2167,5,extremely well polished and Produced album,"I grew up a big Styx fan and followed them through the years. I bought this on cassette way back in 1987 and a few years later I found the original Atlantic CD in some dscount bin (what a find!).I think this is the BEST Shaw solo effort (""What If"" comes in very close though).The songs have a very rich texture and are very well produced. Songs like Outsider and Lay them Down are very well done. No Such thing, the only single and video is a great rocker. I was amazed the album totally bombed in 1987 and even more shocked when a few years later Tommy Shaw become a household name when he scored the No.3 hit with Damn yankees, it was Atlantics time then to re-release this album and market it, they seriously dropped the ball or prob didnt even remember they signed him to a one time record deal.This remains a lost treasure. The songs are great, there isnt a crappy song on this album. a solid 5 stars."
2168,5,Candid comments about his own observations.,"Excellent book for someone trying to obtain insight into characters of the conflict. Sorrel is candid and generally does not fall into the ""hero worship"" that many Confederate Officers did when writing their memoirs.He makes it very clear throughout the book that his observations are his own and may be flawed when viewed historically (and some are).Very easy reading -- not a lot of Victorian memorializing and generally flows well. A real good book for the beginner or historian alike."
2169,3,buyer beware!!,"Bought this product as a ""new"" product. Got it, and installed it, and it would not work. The base was ok,but the light would not come on. My dad has the same thing,so we tried his light,and his worked great. Upon closer inspection, we found that the bottom plug on the pole light where it plugs into the base had been tampered with and opened before. This item appeared to be in factory packaging, but the light pole had plier marks on it where I guess someone else tried to get into the wiring after it would not work for them. After about 2 hours of working with it,and rewiring it, we finally got the pole to work. I was very dissapointed that this seller advertised this as a new product, when it was clearly used, just repackaged."
2170,3,Pretty Good Lugosi Vehicle,"Lugosi's horror movies of the late thirties and forties for Monogram pictures weren't particularly memorable or ingenious, but they served their purposes and were reasonably entertaining. In this movie, Lugosi is haunted by the ghost of his dead wife, and every time he sees her, he is put in a murderous trance. The plot is kind of hokey, but there are a few atmospheric scenes, and the acting is surprisingly good for this kind of movie.The DVD from St. Claire Vision is in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Unsurprisingly for a public domain horror movie, the picture is plauged with scratches, and it is consistently blurry (although if you're shopping in the bargain bin, like I did, you should know what to expect). There are no extra features, which is also unsurprising."
2171,3,Bela's First Monogram Thriller,"""The Invisible Ghost"" (1941) features an effectively underplayed Bela Lugosi performance and some striking directorial touches courtesy of Joseph H. Lewis - eight years before his cult classic ""Gun Crazy."" As a result, this atmospheric thriller rises above the usual Poverty Row fare. Clarence Muse provides memorable support as the non-stereotypical butler. One of Lugosi's best Monogram efforts. The Roan Group DVD includes a good 35mm print and the original trailer."
2172,1,Broken within 2 weeks,"I used this product for less than an hour a day, and the band broke within two weeks."
2173,2,This is really for a teacher or counselor,"I was just curious as to what it talks about. I read the foreword only and I felt as though it was not only realistic but outlined as though there is some formula for someone to like you. It may have been informative for someone else but not for me because I do not care who does not like me. Usually people that do not like you do not like themselves and you remind them of something that they are not and never will be.I passed it on to someone else. If you buy this keep in mind that if you love yourself, to not care what someone else thinks becomes second nature. Books cannot generalize a subject like this because everyone is different and there is always inner spirits of people in conflict with one another. If people do not like you that means you are doing something right. Probably not everything but something."
2174,1,Cheaply made!,"These weights break apart VERY easily...the material is very cheap. They don't last and not worth the money, even on sale"
2175,5,very satisfied,have nothing negative to say about this product. Very please!delicious satisfying I use these every day and I have no problems with any leakage from the product. Thanks for such a marvelous product.
2176,2,Ripped After 2 Months,"I purchased these weights for my 9 year old daughter, who has a petite build. They fit perfectly on her ankles, but would likely be too small for anyone over 5 feet. After wearing them a couple of times each week for two months, a rip developed along one of the seams and the sand came out. This is upsetting because otherwise these weights were perfect for my daughter - snug fit, soft fabric."
2177,1,Not what I thought,These are a real disappointment. I thought I was buying 2 2lb weights. What I recceived was 2 1lb weights. they are very small and hard to get over my hands. I keep them overnight on a beer glass so that I can put them on. The accompanuing folder was for women. I will never againybuy items like this va the internet.
2178,1,Useless Waste of Money,These one pound wrist weights are pointless. They offer no useful weight resistance. My watch is heavier than these!
2179,2,Get ready to play pick up.,If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights.
2180,3,wrist weights,I found the weights to be of good quality. I do not have any other comments for this product at this time
2181,1,Way Too Small!,"Do not ignore the previous posters complaints about the size of these weights. I did! I'm a woman with a wrist 6.75 inches in diameter and I wear a size 7 or medium glove. These weights are extremely hard to get on and very uncomfortable to wear. I really think they are only suitable for a child or a very, very small woman.Also the weights I received do not look like the pictured item. Valeo seems to have changed the entire design of these. Maybe they were better before? The pictured item seems to have a larger diameter in the opening. The ones I got desperately need some elastic or something."
2182,2,too small,"Very hard to put on, they are not very big, and I am a slender petite woman with little hands & wrists, but it feels like I am scraping my skin to get them on and off, do not care to wear them at all. Look nice, built well, but need to make bigger. Going to see if I can return them or resell them myself."
2183,2,not so great,came in great timing but after useing them for afew workouts a little sand came out of the seam.
2184,4,Easy Workout,Comfortable to wear on your wrists while you are walking or just doing every day choirs. I wear them a few hours a day on days I don't go to the gym. They appear to be doing the job of firming my upper arms.
2185,3,"Okay, but not great","As a primer I got this book, Jill Dyche's CRM Handbook and John Freeland's The Ultimate CRM Handbook. While you probably could use all three to get a full understand of a very broad topic, I personally found the other two to be more insightful."
2186,1,"Beware, only Castillian spoken here",This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent. Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain. No Latin American countries use Castillian! You'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use.
2187,5,"Can't talk, Need to save Hyrule","This is THE soundtrack to buy. Don't go for the English version. Who needs English anyway? I am taken aback each time I listen to this soundtrack. It is so great. The sound is crystal clear. With every song, I am taken back to Hyrule itself. Over 80 tracks, this soundtrack leaves nothing behind. Did I mention the sound? I'd love to review more, but this soundtrack has made me want to play the game again."
2188,3,"Use Only if you have very Dry, Damaged Hair...","I have a difficult time finding a shampoo that's ""just right"" for my combination hair: oily at roots, dry at the ends. I mostly use a daily shampoo for normal/oily hair but then my ends can really dry out, so ocassionally I need to indulge with some Moisturizing shampoo or conditioner. So, I decided to try this product. MAN. This is very ""nourishing""...it made my hair look so ""oiled down"" that I thought that maybe I didn't rinse it all... After a 3rd rinse, I still couldn't blow dry the ""wet look"" away.I'm sure that it is a good product if your hair is VERY dry. Not good for normal hair and if your hair is slightly oily, stay away!!"
2189,5,Beautiul music (and I hate the game too..),"Yes, I'm one of those people who hate FF8. Having said that, I heard a friend play this music one time, and not being that familiar with the music, I was intrigued. He told me what it was and after listening to 2 tracks, I bought the album. And it's nothing short of GREAT. The composer is a genius, and I'm now thingking about getting all the Piano Collections. It's a shame not many people know that game music is as beautiful as this."
2190,3,strangely limited,"The book has a very narrow view, focused on ultimate luxury and non-afrikaaner history. oddly, safe is equated with boring. hotel guide is absurd, with proices rangeing from expensive to stratospheric. despite the above, it does contain decent and useful information, and is worht the money. it cannot, however, serve as the sole bookin in planning a trip."
2191,3,Not One of Her Best,"A longer novel than usual for Christie, ""Cat Among the Pigeons"" deals with international intrigue at an exclusive English girls' school. A coup in the Middle East triggers off a deadly search for missing jewels. Action converges on the school. The Special Branch and local police try to solve the string of murders among the schoolmistresses, but it takes Hercule Poirot's little grey cells to see through the disguises and subterfuge and bring all the loose ends together. The plot seemed flimsy at times and some of the attitudes expressed in the novel made it appear dated in the extreme. For a better Agatha Christie set partly in the Middle East, I would recommend They Came To Bagdad."
2192,4,How far can one go?,"How far can a person really go to kill, to slice on'e self, to glide through the world of evil. Poirot, the belgian detective scrambling through the holes of a mystery like a mouse, not powerful but ready to zoom in.That day when I went to the library he was prepared to zoom in to a barden school for girls. It seems very peaceful until two teachers die. The interesting thing about this book ias that Poirot comes at the end. Thsi is a sign.. at the end things gom wrong. In each Poirot mystery there is a lesson to be learned, a thread to pull on. Not 0only these suspects learn, but we do too! This book has elemants of a regular mystery but thery disapear to a far away island they do not escape but get covered. By Hercule Poirot, the suspects. And I still now am getting covered up. For Iam a cat among the pigoens, we all are and all will be."
2193,4,Thinking horror,"It took me a while to get really ""into"" this one. However, I was really hooked from page one because I just couldn't put it down. The writing is lyrical, nearly poetic, the images created are haunting. The novel introduces a series of characters on a variety of levels; nothing is truly as it first appears in this novel. The Succubus is such an incredible character; she is erotic and dangerous without any other motive than to fulfill her purpose for coming to earth. Her image will stick with you throughout this read. The dialogue is intelligent and realistic, the images are sharp, and the plot keeps building throughout the novel. This is a must-read for the intelligent horror reader."
2194,5,Third time's a charm,"I'm listening to this record for the third time as I write this, and it's not going to leave the CD player anytime soon. Immediate favorites on the disc are ""Pillars"", ""Every shining time you arrive"", the title song, and one of the last 3 (I don't recall- they're all good). In the words of Jeremy Enigk, ""The new album, pardon my french, is gonna kick a__!""- and it does. It's mellower on average than ""Diary,"" and all the new stylistic touches of s/t are used plus even more new stuff. The sonic variance gives them even more depth of expression and makes for a truly enjoyable listen. The lyrics are as great as I expected. I just can't praise it enough. An instant classic."
2195,4,It's About Time to Write a Review for this Record,"Well I've owned this record for four years now, almost to the date. It's a great album- the guitars ring in counterpoint, the bass is melodic, the drums pound. . .subtely, and Mr. Enigk spouts forth a little LESS elliptically than in the previous two records. There's even a little piano line, etc. I think that this was their best studio recording, personally.Buy the album and love it."
2196,1,Who is the translator?,"With hundreds of versions of The Cherry Orchard available, you would think that Amazon would have the sense to name the translator. I think this is the same version used by LA Theater Works in which case the translator would be Michael Frayn."
2197,5,Timeless,"The Cherry Orchard was me first experience with Chekhov, and I was surprised at the depth in this 49 page play. By no means would I considered myself a ""literary expert,"" but this was very readable and you can pull a lot of the deeper meanings and its context in Russian history by yourself. I was confused at a couple people who write that the simply couldn't understand it and it put them to sleep! It's not THAT tough! If I could understand and appreciate it, almost anyone can!What I like most about Chekhov is that he doesn't simplify his characters. He's a realist in this sense. Lopahkin and Trophimof each have admirable and detestable characteristics, just like you and I. While it may be set in the tumultuous period prior to the Russian revolution, the ideas and the discussions this play provokes are timeless.Highly recommended!"
2198,4,"Lego doors, windows, and roof tiles",Great for kids who like legos and never have enough doors and windows. Will keep them busy for hours.
2199,5,Vocally obnoxious and musically brutal,"Start to finish, it's like Judas Priest on steroids and a singer that is so over the top on his highs it's like a banshee having a seizure. The music is heavy, catchy and intricate and his vocals soar over it all making it ten times more intense and fun, yes fun to listen to. Some disagree and think his vocals are TOO OTT but it all comes down to personal opinion. It's like a metal opera that is very dramatic. It can go from vengeance to a very emotional state from song to song and it takes you on a journey. You know those crazy Italians. They're intense in everything they do and it is all over this cd. I bought this purely because I thought the cover was ridiculously awesome. I mean, a centurion holding a pump action sawed off shotgun? Sold."
2200,3,One Dimension of War,"Brian de Palma's film is based on a true incident during the war in Vietnam, in which some G.I.s decided to ""reward"" themselves for their efforts with a South Vietnamese girl, whom they proceeded to [attack], torture, and murder. Michael Fox is good as the ""good guy""; Sean Penn is better as the leader of the pack. All roles suffer from one-dimensionality."
2201,3,depalma need i say more.,One of the best vietnam movies of all time. fox performance was great.sean penn also created a realm of dishonor. thet had not been seen in film before.depalmas direction was great as always and i think that it was an over all great movie. and a must buy for any one who likes war movies.
2202,1,Poor,Disk#1 - too few wordsDisk#2 - starts with based on reading; but there are no lessons on how to readetc
2203,3,Maggie Can do Better,"I almost didn't finish this book because it was so trite, but being a Maggie Osborne fan, I continued reading. In my opinion, it didn't get a whole lot better.I felt like another reviewer who said they suspected it was one of Osborne's first books and she lost her way in this story. If this had been my first Maggie Osborne book, I would not have continued reading more of her books, but this is one of the last books of hers that I have read, so I know she can do better. She is ordinarilly a fabulous writer."
2204,4,Skip the the last three tracks ...,"... because that's all you need to hear. Absolutelyincredible. Aeris' Theme, The Overworld Theme and the most evilvillian music ever- One Winged Angel have all been arranged to a fullorchestra.The rest of the tracks are just mediocre in comparison,but the OST to VII was solid anyway, so they're good to hear.Butunfortunately, unlike the Final Fantasy VIII Arranged album (which isalso sold on amazon ... GET IT), 90% of these tracks are old and justrecycled off the original soundtrack. If you're a diehard fan and mustown everything, get it... those three songs are incredible. If youthink paying [this much] for three songs is too much, well- then passon this one."
2205,1,Disappointed,"The book did bring back pleasant memories of attending a Catholic School. It's too bad that Gina Cascone hated attending a Catholic School. I kept reading hoping that at some time she would say something good about being a Catholic. But that never happened. If I hadn't experienced Catholic Schools myself, this book would convince me that sending your child to a Catholic school is child abuse. I only recommend this book for people who hated being Catholic."
2206,1,Catholic bashing packaged as humor...,"I, too, grew up Catholic. I, too, have hilarious stories of my experiences. How lucky I feel, though, to have been raised to honor and respect my faith. Yes, my old friends and I still chuckle over certain eccentric nuns, over chapel veils and pagan baby collections, but mostly we feel lucky and richer for this experience. Since my patent leather shoe days, I've been widowed (young), lost my father (young), raised six children...no heartache or challenge has been too great, as I have been comforted and strengthened by this two thousand year old faith Gina Cascone so glibly dismisses. Had she remained true to her faith, some of what she says could be taken as good natured fun. She has instead turned her back on Catholicism and puts herself above sacraments and revered practices and beliefs. Her humor smacks of arrogance and ignorance. How sad."
2207,3,Different and cool.,"It's been a while since I read this book, but I wanted to be the first one to review!! The book was filled with small excerpts from Dylan Thomas' life, many of which dealt with surreal type encounters. The first part of the book seemed to lag somewhat, but the last story got me hooked and then ended in a very odd way, which was really cool. Maybe I shouldn't be writing this, I'm no lit expert. I'd reccommend it though."
2208,3,And they call this shampoo SPORT?!,"This could be a really good shampoo...but where is it written that shampoo must smell like a piece of candy? A lot of the ""good"" shampoos I've tried smelled like a candy bar..this one smells like a sour apple jaw breaker. YUCK!It's really a shame. This shampoo leaves your hair conditioned and clean. If it weren't for the aroma I'd give it five stars. But then I may not be a member of their target demographic. So if you prefer wine to a good craft beer, don't eat red meat, and are in touch with your feminine side, this may be the shampoo for you!"
2209,4,One Of The Better Soundtracks,I'm not a huge soundtrack fan but this is a good soundtrack. It has all of the vocal songs from the movie along with most of the instrumental stuff. If you liked the music in the movie this would be a good buy.
2210,3,Great for the movie...But....,"Many people enjoyed the soundtrack to the original Toy Story video...anybody who did will also like this soundtrack. They are both very similar, and Toy Story 2 has themes from the original movie mixed into some of the tracks. However, this soundtrack is not good to just sit down and listen to. Sure, it went perfect with the movie! Fun and happy. But I wouldn't recommend getting this soundtrack usless you really enjoyed it from the movie, and the original Toy Story music appealed to you. It's one of those half and half soundtracks. Get it or don't! Anybody who likes fun music and wants to add a piece to their Randy Newman collection, this is a good CD to do so with."
2211,2,Ho-hum,"Not much new here. I listened to it for the Sarah song, and it is what gave it two stars. Not horrible, but the music is generic movie soundtrack music. The two versions of ""You Got A Friend In Me"" add nothing to the song. ""When She Loved Me"" is a nice song performed wonderfully by Sarah Mclachlan, but not enought to spend money on this whole CD."
2212,2,Hope you like instrumentals!,"I bought this album expecting songs to sing with the kids. The music is probably great, but I have not yet gotten past the disappointment of so few sing alongs."
2213,1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I bought this CD for my 3 year old son after seeing the movie and absolutely loving it! We were so disappointed that we immediately returned it and got our money back! The CD only has 3 songs that are actually sung and the rest are all instrumental. My son was so excited to listen to the songs he had heard in the movie, but when they played they (the main song) was sung by a different person and just not the same. I am sorry to say this was not worth putting a CD together for...they should have just left it in the film for everyone to enjoy."
2214,2,This book appeared to a small group of shepherd girls,"Unlike other religiously oriented books such as the Da Vinci Code, in this one you really have to take religion seriously. If you don't believe, then the book will look silly. If you do believe, then the book will make your beliefs look silly. Kind of a no-win situation. I found it boring.But, more importantly, can we stop publishing books in which ""suspense"" is created and maintained by telling the story from two or three perspectives, then breaking up these stories into three-page fragments?I swear, I almost grabbed a razor blade and cut the book up so that I could reassemble it into a coherent narrative."
2215,5,Spellbinding thriller,"Another Da Vinci Code-like thriller - fast paced of course, but this one is very well written. The Third Secret is driven by the events of the miracle at Fatima, Portugal and a conspiracy in the Catholic Church, if you can imagine such a thing. The intricacies and politics of the Vatican are examined while the story races along, and coming on the heels of the latest conclave and installation of the new Pope just makes this book even more irresistible. Fascinating history, meticulously researched (as always by this author) and spellbinding to boot."
2216,4,Fast paced mix of facts and fiction with no great secret,"If you are looking for a deep secret to be revealed at the end, read no further, its a let down. However, the storyline and the plots are fast-paced and intriguing, that it is unputdownable. It is set against the background of the catholic kingdom, the vatican city, and offers a mix of insightful facts and fiction about the people that run the catholic church. The details of the ceremony and procedures followed upon a pope's death, the conclave and election are instructive.Overall, its a good weekend book that should not be mistaken for a serious theological treatise."
2217,3,Pretty Good,"At least this book didn't try to tear christianity in half - it was quite spiritual and still managed to dispel all the ""falderal"" of the Vatican. Berry is an excellent author and you should read his offerings."
2218,4,"A good, tight piece of FICTION.",People take these books too seriously. It is a work of FICTION that draws upon history. Read it and enjoy it for what it is. It's not the gospel.
2219,1,"I don't normally write reviews of books I didn't finish, but...","... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV."
2220,2,Nothing Electrifying about this Secret,"Father Michener is plagued with worry for his dear friend and mentor Pope Clement XV.Clement is concerned with a starling secret that is hidden in the archives of the Vatican. He then sends Michener on a trip to unravel the mystery of the third secret that the Virgin Mary has reveled to three youngstersGripping page turner? No, the only reason why I kept turning pages was because I was highly expecting a blow out a secret to end all secrets but once reveled I was sorely let downInsights on the Vatican was nothing more than the writers own opinion which makes this book a decent fiction read , one that you can take on a long airplane trip to pass away the timeblah"
2221,3,Could have been MUCH better,"Like many of the reviews here, I feel the author blew it big time in the end. 8/10 of this book is very good, very entertaining and leading up to something big. But then...it happens...(spoilers) the author puts his political ideas (pro-abortion, pro-homosexuality, etc.) into the mouth of the Virgin Mary. I have little problem with the celibacy issue and female priest issue that he also advocates, but even that does not allow this book to wrap up on a positive note.A great book with a cartoon ending, that ultimately means it is a not so great book. If you like Vatican intrigue read 'Angels and Demons' or an actual history book....leave this one alone."
2222,2,The Third Secret: A Novel of (not that much) suspense,"The Third Secret is another entry in the Vatican intrigue genre. It has the usual elements: Vatican conservatives the usual bad guys vs liberal Catholics the usual good guys. The ""Third Secret"" refers to secret revelations given to Marian visionaries at such places as Fatima and Medjugorge, the existence of which is historical fact. If there is any suspense in the novel, it is not with the plot which is remarkably predictable and derivative. The only thing that kept my interest was waiting to find out the actual content of the third secret(s), at least according to the novel's author. In the end, these proved to be rather predictable too, given the author's religious inclinations."
2223,2,Weak Work In The Style Of Angels & Demons Or The Da Vinci Code,"How many stories can intrigue in Catholic Church spawn?Berry tries to imitate Dan Brown (which is also, admittedly, his own basic style) but he really falls flat with this work.Stock characters: a moderate dying pope, a somewhat secret liberal investigating priest, a conservative Catholic powerful priest/villan who is willing to murder to achieve his aims.It all culminates in a real religious ""truth"" that shows that the powerful interests in the Church have really been working against the true will of God (in this case through various Marian appearances) for decades.Not to be a spoiler, but the ultimate ""secret"" wasn't all that exciting either. My own personal views are pretty much in line with Berry's so this is far from a political statement. It just wasn't that much from a thriller perspective.This one can be given a pass. The lackluster plot sinks this one."
2224,2,Author: do homework,"It is difficult to understand why this book has been rated so highly.The place where the Pope spends the Summer is spelled incorrectly throughout. Author: write 100 times ""Castel Gandolfo"" (in the book: ""Castle Gandolfo"")."
2225,3,Homosexuality and abortion are OK.,"Yep that's it, The Third Secret. Oh yeah, throw in the slightly less controversial ideas that priests should be allowed to marry and woman should be ordained, and you've got the whole story. No need to read any further.Why three stars? Because for the first 300 pages this is a better than average thriller. There isn't anything new here, as several other recent books have explored the machinations of the Vatican and papal selection process, but Berry has crafted a tight story with (almost) believable characters.If you're a member of NARAL or NAMBLA, you'll thoroughly enjoy this romp of Catholic bashing.For the reast, try Berry's ""Ambler"" or ""Romanov"" novels; much better and far less offensive."
2226,3,Ok buy it if u really want to.,"Ok. Just where do I start?It seems that the way to sell books these days is to stir enough controversy and hope that the publicity sells it. It used to be political conspiracy theories, these days you take a swipe at major religions of the world.The above is what stopping me from giving anything higher then a 3/5. I admit I enjoyed the cat & mouse game, though not as thrilling as the first time you read the Da Vinci Code. Of the three Mr Berry's books I read, this one I managed to stop the urge to read the last few chapters to find out what the ho-ha is all about.The 'conspiracy' topic seemed rather dated, not too ground breaking (I'm not telling here just in case you do want to get it yourself).In any case, if you need something to buy at the airport bookshop, and need to hold and read something, well... it's ok. You might however finish reading it after you arrived at your hotel."
2227,2,fatima,the author uses a great inspiring event to sneak in at the end of his story his personal perverted idea of morality..this book iwould describe as a piece of garbage..i assinged my copy to the garbage disposal where it belongs....
2228,1,Terrible Book,"This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched. It casts Church conservatives as evil and diabolical men trying to thwart the will of God by hiding and/or destroying the revelations from Fatima and Medjugorie. It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.(...)So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families. How lame and predictable. (...)"
2229,2,Disappointing.,A good book constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. It makes you care about the characters. It stirs emotion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It makes you want to go back to it and keep reading.The Third Secret does none of these.
2230,2,the third secret,"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the ""secret"", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"
2231,4,My review,I am a big Steve Berry fan and have read all of his books. This one is controversial and makes you think about thesubject. Very well written and I look forward to reading his future books.
2232,5,Great read!,This Berry book is a wonderful adventure...easy and exciting...as are all his books. He starts slow...puts in the detail that keeps you engrossed.
2233,4,Blending Action and Reflection,"A great blend of page-turning thriller-action and thoughtful reflection on the state and history of the Catholic church. The craze for books like The Da Vinci Code has mostly died down, but this novel reminded me of why I jumped on that bandwagon in the first place. There is just enough there to make me stop and think about my own faith and beliefs and to keep me engaged with that aspect of the tale, and there is just enough action to keep me turning pages. The writing is sound enough that I truly cared about what was happening, not just for myself but for the characters involved. Really, Berry is a master of that blend, and I especially enjoyed the challenge to reflect in the context of the novel's action."
2234,1,An Insult to all Christians,"I read this book thinking that the author may have some good insight into what the famous ""Third Secret"" of Fatima is, especially in view of today's world. Instead he wrote a book that ended up insulting Christians, Catholics in particular. I was shocked when he finally gets to the end of the book and suggests the Mary was sending messages from heaven implying that God is upset because there is not enough acceptance of abortion ,homosexualitry, promiscuity, you name it. Steve Barry has totally lost it. Don't waste your time or money."
2235,2,Way too much Catholicism,I liked The Amber Room and LOVED The Romanov Prophecy. I was prepared for another terrific book. What a disappointment. This book is far more a fictional in-depth look at the selection of a Pope than a mystery thriller. I found it too far-fetched to be remotely believable.The flyleaf says Steve Berry is at work on his next book. Let's hope it's better than this one.
2236,1,One of the worst six sigma reference,This is one of the worst written six sigma book I have read. It has neither depth or clarityThere are also many mistakes in the book. The formatting is also badly done. It is a poor effort and I am shock that this book is associated with ASQ.
2237,3,great aim,"I think that this book was not too bad, and is worth the buy, but it could be improved. Content wise it was not so bad, but it was the layout and presentation (amateur photographs) with heavily packed text. It looks like a scrapbook a child would throw together - and this may not necessarily be a bad thing considering the audience is children. I was really up in the air rating this one and would have given it a 4 if the organization was a bit cleaner. It deserves a 5 if it was organized a bit better ""and"" images were professional throughout - so you can see why I am saying it is worth a buy.If your child has an interest in becoming a vet this is a recommendable book, along with others, and let them decide if the content within is worth a visit."
2238,2,Broken after a few uses,"Filter is a little narrow, but it worked fine until I unscrewed it during the third use. Perhaps I overtighted it, but it was a little hard to unscrew from the lens. When it finally came off, the two glass pieces separated. Unfortunately I wasn't able to reassemble the two pieces, so I tossed them in the trash and thought to myself, ""That's what I get for [...]."""
2239,1,no!!!!,"iguess you have to be stoned to enjoy this moviebecause any other way its just bad its just not interesting ,not funny, not worth it"
2240,3,Older Works Better! This Is Too Sticky!,This newer version of leave in treatment left my hair feeling stiff and sticky. I'm trying to get away from weighted down hair and get that natural soft feeling without it. I've found that just a small amount of cheap ole regular rinse out conditioner actually works better. Just rub small amount in palms and distribute evenly through hair ends.
2241,1,Extreme Disappointment,Don't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one (which was shipped very promptly) refused to accept a charge after a day or so. While Amazon sent a replacement as soon as I reported the problem the second one has now stopped accepting a charge after three weeks.The service (as always) from Amazon has been great but needless to say this particular batch of batteries has some inherent problems so look at the alternative brands available at amazon.
2242,3,Just ok,"I would have to agree with another review that said this movie was disappointing. Indeed much of it seemed pointless. To me this was a movie that had a lot of potential, but never really explored that potential. To explain more would take a while and give away spoilers, suffice to say you're not missing anything here. If you're a fan of ji-hyun jun then maybe see it just for her, but that's about it."
2243,4,A wonderful book for pilots and dreamers alike,"Richard Bach describes the marvel of flight so well in his easily-digested shorts about airplanes, personal journeys, and philosophy. I almost don't need the book anymore- several of the stories are so easily recalled, not for their context of wings and propellers and runways, but for the enthusiastic care for freedom and self-determination that Bach extends to the reader."
2244,4,Tivo is much better than your cable company's DVR,"Tivo is a great service and well worth the extra costs compared to the cable or satellite company DVR. It works well, is reliable, and will truly change the way you watch tv. The downside to all this is that most Tivo boxes (except for the expensive Series3) all rely on analog cable connections. This will be a problem in the future, as cable companies move away from analog systems and to digital systems. (Of course, there are work-arounds, but they aren't very elegant or cost effective). As long as you know this limitation, and that the future of the Tivo Series2 is limited - it's the best thing since sliced bread and well worth every penny!"
2245,5,Must-have item,Whatever did I do before my TiVo?? This product has performed as promised. No sweat with the set-up and veddy-veddy user-friendly!! I highly recommend it to anyone.
2246,4,Love my Tivo!,"Learned of Tivo and how it works at my brother's house. I love mine, but I guess due to it's age it is now sticking and often I have to unplug it to get it going again. Also, it is changing channels by itself now at times. Overall, though, I love it."
2247,1,TiVo TCD49080 Series2,"This model TiVo is out of date. It will only record Digital and Analog programs and NOT Hi Def. You must have a Multi-Channel tuner card installed in order to receive cable TV channels -- this costs $1.50/month plus a $20.00 installation charge from Comcast -- plus the monthly charge from TiVo is $12.95 (as I recall) -- this is an EXPENSIVE proposition.I'm returning the TiVo because Comcast offers their Hi Def DVR for $9.95 for 6 moths, then $12.95 there after.Oh did I mention that if you have Vonage or cable telephone service that you MUST buy a wireless adapter for ~$50.00?This is not only an outdated piece of equipment, but a very expensive solution to recording TV programs/movies!"
2248,2,Dual Tunner noooo,Tivo is a big rip-off. I purchased a TiVo TCD649080 Series2 80-Hour Dual-Tuner on line and hooked it up for 1 month at $9.95 and after a week I found it could only record 1 channel at a time so I called and canceled it. So for that one-week they charged me $109.50 and said it was an early termination fee. Even the Cable Company is not that bad beware of the moneygrubbers. Get you DVR from your cable or sat provider their Dual tuners are real dual tuners not pretend tuners.
2249,3,"Great information, poorly written.","Military historians are notorious for being poor writers; they seem to have a quota on the amount of howevers, moreovers and indeeds they must put into a book. This reference sets the bar, I scanned the book to my computer and did a count of the historians use of the words however, moreover and indeed; 322 howevers, 297 moreovers, and 244 indeeds.The writer had one more extremely annoying habit, for some reason he loves to use the phrase ""none other than."" For example the pilot was none other than the squadron commander; or the passenger was none other than the president.The book is very difficult to read because of the writers frequent use of writer's crutches. If the reader can ignore that, this book is still quite interesting."
2250,1,Piece Of Poo!!!,"This is the worst cd i have ever heard. If you like no hooks and, emotionless dribble then this is the record for you. was this recorded through an A.M. radio? I wouldn't give this cd to my worst enemy.THIS SUCKS!!! I want my money back!!!"
2251,1,boring,If you like this album you will probably like any other mediocre band out there now. It is the same recycled music over and over. Over singing and generic guitars make for a bland album. Just my opinion.
2252,5,incredible cd,"i just picked this cd up on a whim today because i saw a good review of it on alternativeaddiction.com awhile back. This is alternative rock at its finest, some of the best i have heard in a long time. Highly reccomended"
2253,1,GARGAGE,"Please. Save your money and don't buy this or any other book by Gail Howard. The entire premise of number combinations that are more likely to hit is bogus. It sounds good but its not real. Do some research online about statistics and probability. Each remaining ball has the same odds of being drawn. There is no skill to these types of lottery games-unlike say following the remaining scratch ticket prizes available for a certain game online and seeing what is the best buy. She has her success by people randomly winning with her book. Those that win are publicized. Those that don't are quietly forgotten. Seriously, youll win more money by taking the money you would have spent on this book and buying lottery tickets."
2254,1,THE SAME SONGS,"THIS GUY IS SSOOOOOOOO WACK IT HURTS.....HE RECYCLES SO MANY LINES AND EVERY ALBUM OF HIS THAT YOU BUY HAS THREE TO FOUR DUPLICATE TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM BEFORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT BEAT. ITS RIDICULOUS....WHAT ARE THEY PAYING HIM FOR. HE DOESN'T EVER COME WITH ANY NEW MATERIAL....HIS KKKILER FETUS ALBUM HAD NUMEROUS RECYCLED SONGS FROM THE CLOSED CASKET ALBUM AS DID THE GOTHAM CITY CD.....JUST LIKE THE HELLTER SKELLLTER ALBUM , AND ALL OF HIS SUBSIQUENT ALBUMS FOLLOWED SUIT....HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GIVING HIM 5 STAR REVIEWS, I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE IN HIP HOP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY."
2255,2,Disappointment,"This trip down memory lane did not work for me. What was funny when I was a child, now pretty much not at all. Fodder for Goodwill."
2256,3,Billy Connolly - Live in New York (DVD),Product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Not as funny as some of his previous work.
2257,3,"No Subtitles necessary, NY","I own a set concluding all the disks mentioned separately of Billy Connolly's World Tour (New York,Billy Connolly - World Tour of Scotland [Region 2] and England, Australia and NZ).His perfect classic English pronunciation needs no subtitles also this DVD function is possible, jocks are funny as humour is understandable, and shows equipped with nice sightseeing of countries he was performing in."
2258,4,Helpful in understanding dressage,Mueseler of the German School writes a useful text in understanding dressage & riding in general. It has long been a classic & should be considered a must-read.
2259,3,Good tasting nutritional yeast with lots of folic acid reinforcement.,"This yeast tastes better than some. The product has high folic acid reinforcement, five times the recommended total daily allowance in each serving according to the product label as of late 2011. This extra folic acid might be a good thing, might be too much of a good thing, might be a bad thing, or might not make any difference to health. A popular-press medical negative alarm around the year 2010 over the issue of too much folic acid in the diet, or too high a RBC folate level in the blood, I'm not sure which, may have been misleading and both Dr. Kelly Robinson of California and Chris A., a health care professional of Maine say in the comments below, comments posted to an earlier version of this customer review, if I understand correctly, to not worry much if at all about negative health effects of high levels of folic acid in food."
2260,3,"Well written, but way off the mark","I purchased this book just to see how the the Calvinists looked at Holiness, the baptism with the Holy Spirit. It is a shame how the enemy of our souls can deceive us into not believing what the Scriptures so plainly teaches. No one can be holy and retain any sin, to include our sin nature. I believe it was God who stated, ""be holy AS I AM HOLY,"" and BE PERFECT as your heavenly Father is perfect."" My dear friends, God is without sin, any sin. Be careful little heart what you believe.If I believed this type of theology, I would have probably given it 5 stars, it is well written, therefore three with my prayers."
2261,3,Saw it on cable & was not inspired to buy it,I saw 2009's All Star show at it was hilarious. So much so I came to Amozon to buy it. This one I got bored so I did not even watch the whole thing. I'm not crazy about a lot of cursing but if your funny I can handle it better. I did not think Monique was funny just profane. Queens of Comedy was better material. Nonethelss- I say rent before buying.
2262,3,everythang that looks good aint good 4 u.,"This dvd is live. Monique hosts the show and she is off the chain. She addresses Tiger woods situation, marriage, these groupies that try to get professional ball players in trouble and much more. She talks to individuals in the audience during the show like shaq, lisa lessley,Judge Mathis and stephen smith. Michael Blackson was the second funniest comedian. That strong ass AFRICAN accent. Corey Holcomb was aight. He thinks he too cool to tell jokes. Paul mooney had his liberal arts educated jokes that were only funny to people who had college degrees. All in all i recommend this dvd to anybody who likes stand up comedy."
2263,5,Hilarious cynicism,"This is a ""laugh-out-loud"" funny book. Voltaire sounds very contemporary as he lashes out at everything foolish and stupid in the world. I can easily imagine Voltaire giggling hysterically as he wrote this one-and it comes through in this hilarious comedy. Not to be missed."
2264,4,One-note concerto,"I loved this book the first time I read it in college. But after re-reading it, I've concluded that while Voltaire has a lot going on in this story, there is a simple formula directing the action: Candide meets some people. They do him wrong somehow. On the verge of death Candide escapes. Rinse, repeat.I still love reading the early chapters, they are comical masterpieces. I see Cunegonde in an entirely different light now than when I was younger. Candide and Pangloss are still naive morons, of course. And I have new found appreciation for Martin.Overall, Candide is great fun, but can get repetitious. Best read in one sitting."
2265,5,Very good reading but certainly a work of a bad taste,"This book has two things which good book needs: first, it's a work of extremely talanted man, second, it's a book of a person with which you'll never agree. Voltaire was one who talked about bad taste of Shakespeare, but his taste is really extremely bad. When you begin to read this book, you think it to be a work of honest man, but in the middle of it you see that he was just a tricky politician. But it all just adds fun to the reading."
2266,2,Even Proust isn&#65533;t this french.,"This is a french book. French books are, of course, often french, but this one is frencher than most. Ah, Pierrot! Reading this fine french book makes me the sad clown of life. Could Voltaire be any frencher, you ask? I doubt it. I am a sad clown, I say. Even when he criticizes the French he does so in a, how do you say, french way. Oui, oui! So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown. Sacre Bleu!!!"
2267,3,"Good, but not great","I recently read Candide for a college history course and was not disappointed at all. I found it moved very well (spatially as well as dramatically) and the Voltaire's wit is everything is has been cracked up to be, not losing much to the passing of time. Overall, very enjoyable and reader fridenly. The only reason I didn't rate it higher than I did is that, due to its rapid movement of plot and action, Voltaire does not give us quite enough philosophical miles to the gallon. Too much of the novella is dedicated to the action and not enough to the thoughts and ideas of the characters involved."
2268,2,A BAD ANIME,I can say that this a bad anime.the animation quality is average and the story is dull from start to finish.There isnt any heat or excitement and it doent have a real ending.
2269,3,Too old,"It's made for the Macintosh. Unfortunately, the book isn't available as an updated version for the newest Adobe Professional. The examples are quite simple."
2270,3,Varied offering with some great jams and tepid covers,"The Godfathers of Groove comprise Rueben Wilson (Hammond B-3organ), Bernard Purdie (the consummate session drummer), and Grant Green Jr. (guitars and the son of jazz legend, Grant Green), and Jerry Jemmott (bass guitar).When on their game, this ensemble sounds just as you hoped they wood: plenty of funky, jazzy grooves; a loose jazzy vibe; and reason to appreciate vintage JBL speakers. It doesn't matter whether the results are soul or jazz or something in-between.The original tracks are the strongest. It's hard to garner much interest, however, in yet another remake of Just My Imagination, and this one sounds polished but perfunctory. The other weakness, in my view, is that half the songs here do not hold up to repeated, focused listening, and the covers in particular sound too much like lounge music."
2271,3,Vir-us?!,"Interesting read. King's ""The Stand"" for younger readers is the best way to sum this story up. It was somewhat a slow start, however, ends good.I feel there is no major character development going on in this book, however there are two more I've yet to read. The only two characters I really feel any strong emotions towards are Hunter and Angerman. Hunter is one of the main characters and seems to me pretty level headed. Angerman on the other hand is kind of creepy. I seriously hope is killed off in this series soon. He agitates me too much. Him doing so, however, proves to me that his character was well developed (seeing that I feel so strongly towards his demise).Overall a pretty good read."
2272,4,A Rollicking Lusty Highlands Romance! I Loved It!,"This was my favorite Garwood book so far... I actually laughed during parts of it and truly enjoyed the story which I'd describe as a rollicking lusty Highlands adventure! The characters were well-developed. Since I'd already read The Secret, which was a book that preceded this tale, I loved reading a bit involving characters from that tale also ..."
2273,4,This is one of her better stories in the past few years!,"The story line and characters were full of detail and charm. This book reminds me of her books prior to the ""Rose"" series. Both Brodrick and Ramsey were such strong characters in her previous book with Judity and Ian Maitland that I was glad to see ""their"" story. However, I felt Ramsey deserved his own book or more of this book to share his story. I feel his character and involvment could of been enhanced in greater detail and length. I liked the pace of the book, it kept moving throughout the story."
2274,2,Mixed Up,"This book would have been better if the couples were switched though to tell you the truth I don't understand why Bridig was even in the book, she was extremely irritating. Brodick was also another irritating character, I mean like some kind of wild caveman. I Liked Gillian and Ramsey and think they would have made a better couple. This is her first book where I think she overwrote the male lead. This is the first book I've read by JG that I wasn't crazy about but Gillian, Ramsey, Ian and Judith made up for the shortcoming with this one."
2275,3,Ransom,"I'm a fan of Ms. Garwood, but please madame, try to enforce some shrewdness into your heroine's character. Gillian just irritated and upset me throughout the novel. She is described as having a strong character, but does nothing to emphasize this. I found her dense, very slow in the brain, and lacking, especially when the priest was marrying her to the hero (couldn't she get the hint that she was getting married, how stupid can a person be!) As for the hero, I must admit that for the setting of the story, he was described in such a way that did justice to his character as a Scottish laird, even if all he wanted to do was to get her in the sack."
2276,3,Actually..3 1/2 stars.......,"""Ransom"" started out very strongly with a very well developed plot and likeable characters,however, I felt that once Gillian and Brodick met, the story fell flat....I believed this for a couple of reasons...the first reason being...All of the attention was focused on the development of the plot, but we were rushed into Gillian's and Brodick's relationship...for this reason, I didn't care overlymuch about the outcome of their love....But my main problem with this book was that we didnt really get to know Bridgid and Ramsey...I was so interested in them..I feel that they should have gotten their own book...all in all ..not a bad read...there were some definite perks..for instance, I adored Alec..he was so sweet...and I really enjoyed Bridgid with her myriad proposals.....This book had such promise, but there were just too many loose ends when it was all over and done with.....NOT Garwood's best."
2277,4,Good story.... Just lacked a little,"So I love Julie Garwood. Her books are great, however this one is just good. I do feel that it lacked a bit of emotion between Brodick and Gillian. They don't meet until page 130! More info needed to be in there about Brigid and Ramsey, it would have made the ending have more of an impact! Anyways, it's still good and worth the read, just not as good as The Bride or Saving Grace! Just started reading Honor's Splendour."
2278,2,TSTL Heroines ...,"I bought the new Kindle version of this book. Believe it or not, I just started reading Julie Garwood and have liked her work for the most part. I loved The Prize and The Bride. Lions Lady was okay. I did not like Ransom at all. The heroines both seemed weak to me and the heros were always in control and getting the better of the heroines. The heoines never stuck to their guns on any issue and there were several badly needed ""hero grovels"" scenes missing. Honestly, I didn't feel the love. Oh well. I'm thinking of trying the Secret just to fill in Judith and Ian's story, but I'm not sure I'm interested anymore."
2279,5,THIS BOOK WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!!!!,"JULIE GARWOOD IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE ROMANCE WRITER. I'VE READ EVERYONE OF HER NOVELS (EXCEPT FOR HER ROSE SERIES)AND I WASN'T DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE. THE HEROINE WAS STRONG, THE HERO WAS FUNNY AND TENDER, AND THE STORY LINE JUST CAPTURED MY ATTENTION. I READ THIS BOOK IN JUST 2 DAYS!!!! I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN IT CAME OUT AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO LOVE TO READ GREAT ROMANTIC STORIES TO GET RANSOM!!! I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEW BOOK TO COME OUT!!!"
2280,5,"An exciting, humorous, sweet romance full of fun!!!","All I have to say is if you are a true Julie Garwood fan you will go and get this book. I love and own all her books and this one did not disappoint. Reading it was like visiting old friends, happy to be there again laughing and crying, yet sad for the good time coming to an end. This book was so much fun to read. You should read ""The Secret"" first, and then read Ransom it will make the story that much more complete. My only regret is that I finished reading it so fast, but that's ok because now I can read it over again, this time slowly."
2281,5,I Loved it!!!!,"This is definately one of my all time favorite books and... I have read a number of them. The plot, characters, and dialouge are well thought out and well developed. The book, Castles, comes before this in the series and it is also very enjoyable. If you haven't read this book, do so."
2282,5,Ransom,"I've read every book Julie Garwood has written. I started in paperback and have watched her books go to hard cover. It's a testimony to how much I enjoy her books, that I can't ever just wait for the soft cover. I rush out and get the book the day it releases. Ransom lived up to all of my expectations. If they asked me to pay twice I would have. The characters are engaging and the dialogue is witty and intelligent. The romance is sweet and romantic in spite of the Buchanans reputation."
2283,2,old and out of date,Was a good book in it's time but is out of date now.Don't waste your money. The up to date Black and Decker is probably great.
2284,4,"A good performance, but there's better copies out there.","This copy of Scheherazade is technically perfect, which is a trait of the current New York Philharmonic. However, I think that the low brass could have been louder (especially during the important tuba part in the first movement). Movements 2 and 3 were really good, but there is some random coughing during crucial sections of these movements. The last movement was too slow during the fast sections and too fast during the slow sections (like the ending). However, Masur delivers the BEST Capriccio Espagnol I have ever heard. Movement 2 was lovely, and the solos were outstanding in movement 4. This copy has great sound quality, but it also muffles the low brass in Scheherazade. For a great Scheherazade, get the copy with Leonard Bernstein directing the New York Philharmonic. It's not perfect technically, but it has got it where it counts."
2285,3,Stubborn Twig,"This was a gift to someone. I talked to the person that got it and she said it was ok, but she would have liked to read more about one particular family"
2286,3,class,This book was required for a class at Eastern Oregon University and I ordered it for use in the class.
2287,3,Beautiful but leaking white powder,"I bought this statue in 2006 from Amazon and I fell in love with it. It's a gorgeous statue. It looks like it's solid bronze, and it certainly cost enough ($148) but it must be only a bronze-like coating because, after about a year, a white powdery substance began to emanate from the crevices of the statue that requires daily wiping to keep it clean. I don't know how this statue was made or how to fix it, but evidently I can't throw a Buddha statue in the trash, or it's considered disrespectful. I wish I knew what was wrong with it."
2288,1,don't recieve,"i buy this one with other four books on 11/12/2008.i still don't recieve this one now.but i have recieved other four books two weeks ago.by asking support why? they let me wait untill January 13, 2008.this is weird.i am in china"
2289,1,waste of time and money,"This DVD is awful. I have never written a review, but after 5 minutes of this DVD I couldn't believe I wasted my money. Maybe a beginner might enjoy this, but certainly not someone who has exercised a day in their life. There is no need for all the breaks except to waste your time."
2290,5,Good DVD,"I bought this DVD after reading all of the great reviews on Amazon as well as checking out Lisa's Youtube page. I enjoy Lisa's no nonsense approach to fitness and her body is amazing and you can't argue with that. I live too far away to meet with a kettlebell trainer I bought this as a beginner intro to kettlebell. I do not regret this purchase, the rests are a little long between sets but I fast forward if I am low on time or continue the exercise from the completed set.I am not a ""sweater"" but I do sweat with this DVD. I know there is room to grow with these fundamentals and I will eventually buy a heavier kettlebell. I am currently using a 20lb."
2291,1,Worst kettlebell dvd out there,Don't waste your money. The only way to make this video a decent workout is to repeat each sequence by yourself during the 2 to 3 minute rest periods which follow each 1 minute of exercise. Terrible. Don't know who gave it five stars. Perhaps the friends of the instructor!
2292,3,Good instruction,"This DVD is good production quality instructional video for very new beginners. No warm-up or cool-down. Good explanation of beginners versions of exersises, but pauses between sets are way to long to get a full benefits of KB workout. For workout purposes I like more Ami Bento videos. Hope next one video from Lisa shell be more workout oriented. If you are total beginner-this one contains a very detailed and visual explanations of form and exersises."
2293,1,Another rip-off from the Asylum,"The Asylum has the reputation of putting out quickly produced rip-offs of major studio movies. Well they have gone across the Atlantic to ""borrow"" their next production. A Finish/German/Austrailian co-production called IRON SKY in which as a last ditch effort to save the 3rd Reich in the form of a base on the moon comes to fruition in 2018 when they return.The Asylum moved the new base to Antarctica and into the earth,added Josef Mengele,some flesh transplants and flesh eating bacteria bombs to this mess. I like some of the Asylum films because they are fun and SOMETIMES are pretty good. But after recently seeing IRON SKY this was painful to watch.The sets were pretty much non existant using warehouses for all the interiors( don't think a cinder block wall would be found inside a UFO).The only effects that worked were the air battles at the end and the ""machine"" Mengele is trying to get to work. This one is best LEFT at the center of the earth!"
2294,5,One of the best books I have ever read!,"This book does an excellent job of explaining the qualities which made Jesus the most remembered, and loved leader in all of history. It is also a good tool to help anyone, in business, or just in life, sharpen their ability to become a great leader. I highly recomend this book to anyone searching for ways to live a happier and more lucrative life. GOD BLESS!!!!!!"
2295,1,VIPER,"how can anyone with half a brain not see through this viper? not only is this book a farce, just look at him on tv, CLUE > he does NOT EVER SMILE, he just peers into the tv like some WWE Wrestler.another clue, he and his ""brethren"" are all peeps in the south, they believe just about anything.Matt 3:7But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, ""Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?Matt 12:34Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.Matt 23:33Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?"
2296,2,This is product is not a tutor,"I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews. This product is not a tutor. It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer, if you click on 'Explanation'. This product offers no tutoring at all."
2297,5,Must Read lesson in Faith and Courage,"This short book contains the story of Humberto Alexander's 22 years in Castro's prisons. It is a story of courage and faith under the ugliest of conditions. Alexander was shot, tortured repeatedly, starved, and treated in the most unspeakably inhuman ways, yet through it all his faith in Christ allows him and his fellow prisoners to survive and even to love those who were torturing them. You will not regret reading this book!"
2298,1,waste of paper and money!,"As a list of what carts were made, it's ok. As a price guide this book is complete garbage. The prices it lists are guaranteed to get you laughed at and chased out of every video game store in America, if not the entire world."
2299,4,solid,"I am very pleased with these levels. The price was great, they are light weight, easy to read and feel super solid. My only beef is that the aluminum sides leave black scuff marks, not a big deal on framing, but a real drag on a white painted cabinet!"
2300,3,From Westrex,"Personally I was Dissapointed in this documentary about the strugle for Stalingrad . To me their was very little new footagethat I had not seen before , in fact it seemed to borrow itemsfrom earlier documentaries which I have seen many times . Forthe price and length of running times ,to me this had to be awinner and I thought this is going to be something very special ,but no , it felt flat . I should have just looked at some DVD'sI have on this subject and forgot this one ."
2301,4,Detailed Hystorical war Documentary,I'm very impressed to view this emotional documentary about Stalingrad german's defeat. The movie's director take care for good images and interviews. Anyone have fun for war review must see it.
2302,1,Professional issues in Speech Language Pathology,"I was extremely disappointed by Amazon. I needed this text book for a course and Amazon sent me the 2nd edition of the text; which is the older version; there is a 3rd edition out of this text.This is a terrible blunder by Amazon and it cost me undue stress and money since I now have to replace it with the newer edition, which I will purchase from my campus bookstore."
2303,3,not up to stuff,"I was disappointed that the description isn't specific about the % down and % feathers, as was the tag on the pillow I had in a hotel. I wanted the same pillow, and I don't think I got it. This pillow is too firm for me. I liked the softness of the hotel pillow. I took a chance and ordered it anyway, but I think next time I'll just offer to buy the hotel pillow I like right on the spot, used and all."
2304,5,A charming film about what happens when you start something.,"This is a wonderful, witty and often heartwrenching film. If you want to know how starting one thing can lead to finishing something else, watch Walters & Caine change each other for the better. A must see for any adult returning to college, if for no other reason than just to keep your morale up."
2305,2,I would like to review it...,"but the seller (greenman19) took my money and I never received the item. Thus, I'm sure the movie is great, but I've still not seen it."
2306,5,The big picture and the small picture,"Two warnings: First, the book is long. Second, the author is conservative and doesn't make an effort to hide it. If these facts don't disturb you then I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is a wonderful story of twentieth-century American politics, crammed with polls, stats, and insightful commentary. Why has ethnicity been a more important factor in politics than class? How did the political pendulum shift from conservatism to liberalism to conservatism again? Who are some of the most important statesmen in history that you've never heard of? And much, much more. If Michael Barone's ""The Almanac of American Politics"" is the Holy Bible of politics, then this work is a book of prayer."
2307,4,Ho Hum,"This is a classic for sure but a classic of what? Most of the people Harrington writes about have created their own worlds and then populated them. Yes, we do feel sorry for the underprivileged but most people in America have the privilege of a free education, free libraries and free charity. If they fail, whose fault is it?"
2308,3,Elite Performance -- Not a Very Good Recording,"I'll make this short & simple. I like the performance, but have a hard time getting past the sound. For some reason the violin sound is completely lacking in the high frequencies. The piano sounds fine, however. I suspect that there was a lot of spotlighting with the microphone placement, and that the violins were recorded too closely. Other recordings I have of various Mozart piano concertos are with Brendel/Marriner, Brendel/Mackerras, O'Conor/Mackerras, Uchida/Tate, Schiff/Vegh. I consider them all the be very fine performances. As far as sound goes, the Goode/Orpheus and Uchida/Tate are my least favorite recordings. The playing by the Orpheus CO is top notch."
2309,3,Jim the Boy: A Review,"If only for the mere fact that I really enjoyed some of the more corky characters like Whitey and the Uncles, Jim the Boy was a bit of a snoozer. Although it was a fast read, I still wasn't connecting with the main character on any kind of level. A pretty good coming of age story, but Jim is no Holden Caulfield in my opinion.The lessons to be learned throughout the book are typical. Some scenes were very touching and well-written, but because I felt disconnected from Jim, I didn't emotionally react. This is a good book to read for leisure, but as far as teaching it to students, one might have a difficult time coming up with material that's fresh."
2310,5,Simple writing that was anything but simple,"What a breath of fresh air - a book of deceptive simplicity that probes deeply into concepts like family loyalty, sacrifice and love. Without ever veering into the overly precious, the author conveys a sense of wonder at life's simple pleasures that we in modern times have all but lost. A distinctive authorial voice, and a life-affirming story that never sets off the Hallmark/Chicken Soup alarm. Nicely done."
2311,5,You will love it,I liked this book a lot. I liked the drawings and the words. I learned alot about nature. I'm glad my mom bought this book for me. Someday I want to work in the outdoors.
2312,5,"A ""Must-Have""!!!","WOW! This book deals beautifully with what was a very painful and tragic day for all of us... and it is a must-have for ALL Americans, for ALL time! The imagery is awesome and sometimes disturbing... but we should be disturbed, and we should NEVER forget! To forget the day... is to forget the huge loss of life. This book not only immortalizes the significance of the events of September 11th, but it immortalizes those who were lost and those who lost, those who were heroes and those who continue heroic efforts on a daily basis. LIFE has done a great job of balancing the tragedy of that day, with the hope for the future. So... as we move forward... and you begin to slip back into a sense of complacency... open this book... look at the pictures and read the words... and I am sure that it will once again seal your resolve to treasure every moment and to continue striving to make the world a better place."
2313,1,Uninformative,"The events of 9-11 are still unfolding 8 years later. Scientists from BYU and the University of Copenhagen have recently completed a well-researched and comprehensive analysis of nano-thermite found within numerous samples taken on and shortly after 9-11. NIST only recently completed their investigation of Building 7, and concluded that fire, alone, caused this 47-story building to freefall (in the exact same manner as an engineered implosion) at 5:20 pm on 9-11. NIST refuses to analyze samples for explosive materials (even after the recent confirmation of presence at the scene of this horrific crime). This book, like the media, does not include these uncomfortable facts...but these facts must be known by every caring citizen of this Nation. Our future depends upon the public taking the time to educate themselves."
2314,5,Interesting history,"As is always the case with Beard's work, I found it very interesting and thorough."
2315,4,one of the top comics in the world,He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.
2316,3,Wrong product received,"The Cosmic Pet Double Wide Scratcher is the best product on the market for cats that love to stratch. However, I did not receive the item ordered. I received 4 regular scratchers with no top. Disappointed."
2317,2,I SADLY MUST SAY THAT THIS IS BORING....,"I'm a huge fan of Kai Hansen. I also like very much some recent works by German powermetal bands ( ""EXCALIBUR"" by Grave Digger and ""NIGHTFALL ON MIDDLE EARTH"" by BLind Guardian, for example ). But Kai Hansen appearance in IRON SAVIOR is almos as guest, since Pit Sielck writes all the songs, sings, plays guitar, bass and keyboards !!! The result is an album in which you clearly see the musicians skills, but where every song sounds the same: a furious metal assault with melodic choruses in between. After the first listening, the CD will be stuck into you collection pile for a long time ..."
2318,5,Best Text for Learning Communication Skills,"I am an instructor for a local college. I selected the Essntials of Business Communication as the textbook for my Business Communications course after working with it in a previous class. It is the best organized text I have found with step by step instructions for students to readily grasp the techniques used in modern business documents. The book covers e-mails, memos, a variety of business letters, reports, business proposals, resumes, letters of application and communication skills for oral presentations and interviews. Lectures, examples, assignments, and grammatical challenges are pre-designed for the instructor's use, making this a turn-key system for teaching communication skills."
2319,2,Learning to Program with Visual Basic,I had to buy this book for a class and frankly it is not a good book. Lots of code errors that make it confusing. Every one of my classmates complained about the book. The professor eventually told us to not use the book and he gave handouts he had written instead.
2320,1,Horrible ending,"I was totally enthralled by this entire series, even the Sherlock Holmes style story of Stonecutter but this ending was horrible. Took a perfectly good sword and sorcery series and turned it sci-fi. I'll read sci-fi when I want that, I read this series for magic and swordplay. I'd read the entire series again and simply leave this one out."
2321,2,THE text on advanced calculus at my school,"I can't believe this is the book my advanced calc 1 class used at university. They sold it to me for $114.50+tax! This is a deal here. This class was the hardest class I took for undergrad. The book was no help. I learned everything I knew from the teacher and from the Internet/study groups. I do like how organized the book is, but the information was impossible for me to learn from the book."
2322,5,the best scratcher,This is my 2d time I bought this replacement for my cat... She likes it so muuuuuch.... when I put catnip... it's awesome how she has a delight by enjoying to claw this kind of simple but effective thing.
2323,5,A Testimony: Conversion to Screenplays,"This affectionate and humorous screenplay moves so quickly it may convert me to reading fewer novels, more screenplays. It is also a beautifully motivated piece and, in my opinion, Gompertz's best writing to date. What a lovely seasonal gift this will make--for yourself or a friend.----Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, awardj-winning author of THIS IS THE PLACE, HARKENING and THE FRUGAL BOOK PROMOTER: HOW TO DO WHAT YOUR PUBLISHER WON'T, the winner of USA Book News Best Book of 2004, Professional Books Category."
2324,5,A Must Read for Catholics and anyone interested in Christianity.,I had this book recommended to me by two people. I'm glad a listened. I enjoyed the read. It was easy to understand and very informative. The book clears up many misconceptions created by hearsay and the media. We Catholics are just as guilty as promoting these misconceptions therefore I considered it a must read. There is also a version available called Catholic and Christian for Teens.
2325,4,Another book bought as a gift,"I bought my mother several crochet books and this is one of them. I don't crochet, so can't give too much guidance, but she liked it and I thought a lot of the patterns were nice."
2326,2,Daughter of time,the book is very boring for my taste but its essential for what you may have to study for the class.
2327,5,"Brilliant, Riveting","Anyone who loves a read about Tudor and Elizabethan times will not be able to put this book down. In it a 20th Century British detective laid up in the hospital solves the mystery of the disappearance of the Little Princes in the Tower. These were the two little boys, sons of the late King Edward IV, who were taken to the Tower of London for ""safekeeping,"" and never came out again. [And whose bodies were found hundreds of years later buried under a staircase in the Tower.] In the end the policeman comes up with the biggest expose in English history. And there is a twist on top of that. Irresistible."
2328,3,Pretty good book,Liked the historical facts and the humour of the dialogue. Sometimes the connections between the various historical figures were hard to follow and the word definitions were difficult to figure out. It certainly made me very interested in Richard III
2329,4,A great King.,"In view of the recent discovery in the Leicester car park, this book throws up some interesting theories about a maligned king. Worth a read."
2330,5,Unique and interesting,"I love everything about this book. I love the pacing, the hilarious comments that you must read carefully to not skim over without catching the joke and the exploration of one of the most intriguing mysteries in English history. Well done!"
2331,1,Poor quality,"I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart, I would not recommend them to anyone"
2332,3,Silk PJ,The product is of decent quality but too over priced. It took quite some time to fill the order. Overall I will not be going back to that vendor and be more selective in the future.
2333,2,RIP OFF-not what they seem,"When you first get these, you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake. But then, when you wash them, they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes. I washed these in cold water, did not put in dryer, yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes. I also washed in a gentle cycle, yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES..so basically after the first wash they are garbage...so unless you plan on having your PJ's dry cleaned, I wouldn't waste my money on these, they were cozy & comfortable at first (although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG) but once they make contact with water they are ruined (even though it says they can be machine washed & dried) I can't imagine if I had put them in the dryer, they would probably turn into doll clothes, save your money & buy the cheaper satin version, at leat they don't get ruined in the wash."
2334,3,Good but for how long.,"My first impression of these was very good the silk is very nice and comfortable the only problem i have with them is how long will they last. After just one wash (in cold, gentile cycle) the small fibers started to come loose near the seems. I hate to see what they would look like after few washes. But I guess if you don't mind dry cleaning your PJs then go ahead."
2335,1,Bad customer service and Cheap Printers,"We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one. Recently, we have had a problem with a big black line through our scanned images. Called again and since it was over a year, they would not help us. AAAH..I will not buy again."
2336,3,"Prints well, poor paper feed","I got this for Christmas and didn't use it much until it was too late to return. The printing quality is terrific, but I get paper jams and/or no paper alerts every time I use it. I have to gently press the paper while it's printing but if it's slightly too hard it jams. What a headache. I use high quality HP paper but it doesn't matter.The online help is free but none of the stuff they said to do works consistently. I've unplugged wires and restarted and changed where the plugs is and everything. It will work while I'm talking to the tech support for that time and then mess up.I expected HP to have a high quality product and I like everything else about it but this tender care to every page I print is horrendous."
2337,1,SMASHED,"I had all the same paper feed, paper jam, customer service problems just like everyone else. I fixed the problem by smashing the printer into my wall. Of course I had to pick up thousands of glass shards and buy some drywall mud, but I feel much better!"
2338,1,"Paper jams, bloated driver, shutdowns","To begin, the software installation is a headache. I had trouble installing it even though I work in IT. Why do you need a 40MB - 200MB driver that requires you to turn off your Anti-virus during installation?! The printer jams often and will sometimes shutdown while printing. While I think HP business grade printers are great, this consumer grade printer is junk."
2339,1,Worst Printer Ever,I signed up just to write this review. I have had printers from Canon Epson Lexmark and Hp in the last 10 years. I have to say that this printer is the worst of the lost.I have had all of the feed issues that others have had and more.My printer cleaned itself so often that the sponge under the ink cartridges actually turned into a mountain. The ink is insanley expensive and does not last long at all. The software is bloated and like others the scanner software just stopped working.I will never buy another HP printer again.
2340,1,The worst !!,"I'm so glad to see others corroborate my experience with this meshuggah printer !Nothing but trouble - paper jams all the time, slow, awful - I thought it was maybe because I was using a Mac but apparently not.STAY AWAY at ANY price !"
2341,1,Causes Reboot Delay...,"The system works great and the clarity is perfect. The problem is when I reboot the computer, it takes 10 minutes. I just get a single flashing dot in the top left corner for 10 solid minutes and then it will finally boot up. If I unhook the printer, the system boots up normally... HELP!!!"
2342,1,HORRIBLE customer support,"Like everyone else, I had the paper feed problem. However, what's really awful is the customer support. I service rep in India took the call, and while I knew exactly what the problem was, it was like talking to a robot. All the rep could do was follow exactly what his script said, then he transferred me to someone else who asked the same exact questions all over again.HP was so gung-ho about offshoring all of their customer service. Well, since I can no longer GET any competent service I certainly won't be an HP customer again."
2343,1,Horrible Scans,I picked up this device to replace a ten year old HP Deskjet & a Canon scanner.It didn't print as well as the old Deskjet & the picture scans were horrible with lines in the image & it didn't seem to have enough gray levels as b/w pictures were clipped
2344,1,HP isn't getting any more chances this time...,"I originally bought the printer in November '05, and it worked splendidly for about three weeks, at which point I had it replaced because, as has happened to so many other people, the printer started refusing to take the paper in the tray out of the blue one day.I got the replacement, unpacked it, and it worked beautifully again. As I was away from my apartment during the Christmas season, it didn't see much use during the return period, and didn't stop feeding paper again until I (finally) threw the box away three days ago.I'd never buy a computer from HP, but I thought, ""It's just a printer, and what are the chances of the same thing going wrong twice?"" Pretty good, apparently."
2345,1,You've done nothing to deserve this,"No piece of hardware should be as painful to use as this was. Not a bad printer when it worked -- but between the expiring ink cartridge issue, which a web search will tell you more about, functions that were dead on arrival, flaky tech support, paper feed issues, expensive ink, bloated hardware, and a scan/copy button that did nothing, it didn't work often enough. It does have an ethernet port, but there's no point in networking a printer that doesn't print. Also, if you get stuck with vague cartridge errors, removing one of the two ink cartridges may be a work around. Not acceptable performance, though.This printer's about to go the way of Old Yeller, and be replaced with something that actually prints."
2346,2,Wrong Region,"Not really sure how the whole region thing works, or which region I live in. It's obviously not region 2, because this disc, although in great condition, refuses to play in any dvd player around. Will be returning it if possible. Shipping time was excellent though, it arrived two weeks ahead of the expected arrival date."
2347,1,Who Framed Rogerll Rabbit - REGION 2,I can't believe Amazon actually shipped this product to someone living of MAssachusetts seeing it was for Region 2 which I had no idea what that was. We found out when we tried to play it and it wouldn't play. It cost $12+ and by the time all the charges were taken off we only got a $3+ credit when we returned it.
2348,1,Bad movie,"When i received the movie, it wouldnt play in any of the dvd players that we have in the house,,i think the movie was a fake!!!!"
2349,3,actually the first DVD was censored,"there were a couple of quick digital edits Disney made to Roger Rabbit, when they first released it on DVD. check the cut list at [web address]for complete information on these edits, and hope that they restore Zemeckis's original vision for this release!(I checked 3 stars only because some stars have to be given. If it is the original cut, make that 5 stars)"
2350,5,I love it .,"This movie produce in year 1988 , it was very good movie then , but when I witch it again now , I love it more and more than before ."
2351,1,This is a disgrace to DVDs,"There could have been so many extras here, and we get nothing. When the movie aired on network television, it put in entire sequences that made the cutting room floor, including the weasels painting a pig head on Eddie. Not only do they not give us the cut scenes, but I would have also liked to see some ""making of"" features or maybe some commentary. Anything! This movie deserves better."
2352,1,DVD doesn't work,"The DVD came rattling in the box. When I tried to get the DVD to play my DVD player it said, "" wrong region."" I'm not sure what this meant???. All my other DVDs work just fine."
2353,4,I liked it.,"Being a kid, I probably shouldn't have seen this movie, but it was awesome! The cartoon elements are cool, and Bob Hoskins makes for a great show. My parents hate this movie because of all the language, but I thought it was great! Definately a must-see if you love cartoon/live action movies. No wonder it won a ton of Oscars!"
2354,3,who indeed?,"this is a ground breaking cartoon/film.basicly,roger rabbit,a cartoon rabit,is married to jessica whose a cartoon human.shes a real hussy and plays patty cake with another man.i think hes a real person.then that guy gets whacked.so,this drunken detective goes out searching for who framed roger rabbit.it IS designed for kids,however there are a few things to watch out for such as strong language and rogers wife who makes my toes curl and i know shes only animated.the detective gets drunk as often as possible too.it is the very first movie where animated and real life characters interact.overprotective parents beware!"
2355,5,Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,wonderful mix of animation and real time actors. Harkens to old MGM days when Jerry the Mouse danced with Gene Kelly. Bob Hoskins is great in the detective role.
2356,1,Featureless DVD,This DVD is a very weak release of a terrific movie. There are no bonus features -- including scenes once broadcast on network television -- and Disney went back and changed some of the animation to sanitize it. Here's a big thumbs down and I hope they re-release it with the original animation and with enough features to make the DVD worth the price.
2357,4,The problem at the end of the movie,"At the end of the movie, their is the Roger Rabbit short Tummy Trouble (Amazon.com sells the other two shorts on VHS) I noticed that the entire cartoon was discolored slightly. If this is what ""Digital Restoration"" is than I want no part of it. They take the crisp, sharp colors and dull them down! does this make any sence?"
2358,3,Not bad for the price,"I bought one of these after my second Sonic Care died within a year. The toothbrush does not clean quite as well as a Sonic Care but it is much better than a manual toothbrush. You don't need to spend the kind of money they are offering them for here however. Found mine at a ""big box"" for a lot less money. You might also want to consider an Oral B sonic for about $24 at a big box."
2359,1,OMG this is so awful,"how can you people listen to this? this is so awful. i can't stand this... abomination. the pace is so gruelingly slow. i dont mind slow songs every now and then, but jesus, this is slower than slow. these guys give a new meaning to the word slow. it may be a little bit more listenable if they picked up the pace just a little bit. but its so slow, how can they even play that slow, its so mindnumbing, i cant stand it, it drives me insane. its so dark, and its also frightening. i just cannot listen to it. the only reason i checked this horrific disc out is because it got such rave reviews. call me what you will, but i would not recomend this to anybody. i cannot see how anybody could like this. its so awful."
2360,3,Completely misses the hardest part of going to Mars,"Which of course is politics.The technology to go to Mars has existed since the 1970s. What no longer exists is the political will to do so.When I was a teenager growing up in the 1960s most everyone was ""space happy"". We all assumed permanent bases on the moon and a manned landing on Mars within 10 years.Today we have no U.S. manned space program, no way for us to get into space. Sure, decades from now there MAY be a robust private space-travel industry. But that is a long time. In the interim, space will be owned by Russia and China.When John F. Kennedy pledged to go to the moon, he meant it. He had an intense personal commitment to the enterprise. He delivered speeches remembered to this day. He dedicated astronomical sums to make it happen.What should our space program be like? Search the Internet for ""Man conquers space"" and watch the trailers."
2361,3,The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the old testament,"This Lexicon is way above my paygrade, to hard to use. I'm sure people with PhD's get it. I will have to look for an easier book to use."
2362,5,My all time favorite movie,"This is my all time favorite movie. I Know most people don't like it. But I don't understand why it has to be like the game. What kind of movie would this be, if it was? Come on it would be two guys running around jumping on Gumba's heads. Not saying I have anything aganist the games. They're fun and challenging. And who couldn't love Spike and Iggy and don't forget Yoshi. All you people who hated , it's your fault we don't have sequel! It will always be the best movie."
2363,3,An OK cheesy video game movie.,"This was passable entertainment, nothing more. It is not as bad as people make it out to be, and it is certainly better than most horrible movies i've seen. The two leads have good chemistry which works, and Dennis Hopper does an OK job playing Koopa. The script is campy, and the lines given by the two guys in the cab is plain dumb. Just watch this movie once, or twice, but it does the video game it's justice."
2364,2,Super Mario Bros The Movie,"Hello People, I am going to be reviewing a Movie that ruined my school reputation.... The Movie itself is OK....These famous actors who are chosen to play mario and luigi are acting in this movie, OK.. So I was in first grade when I watched this on VHS, and then my best friend Louis who was sitting next to me at story time was talking to me and then this picture from the movie came in to my mind and I told him ""Let's be bad!"" From that day in first grade I would always go to the pricipals office and never complete assignments. That is why I would NOT recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 10, if you are 10, please have an adult with you so you don't get any ideas.Huge Mario Bros fan that is above 10... OK you can watch it, if you are age 9 or below please steer clear of this title.Please get this movie if you are above the age of ten!J.R. Platt"
2365,2,Mario and Luigi on the big screen..not so good,putting Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the plumber brothers Mario and Luigi. Samantha Mathis is Princess Peach and Dennis Hopper is the boring King Bowser. some good moments here and there but whats the deal yo. the games are better then this monstrousity. damnit...they should of made a cartoon version. Leguizamo and Hoskins are ok as the brothers but wow.....not good and the Yoshi dinosaur is idiotic
2366,2,pitiful,"If you ask me, any movie that is based on a video game and they don't have similar story lines is a lame attempt at a movie. Lets take a look at the games, it doesn't take place in a city, iggy and spike are dinosaurs, Yoshi is not a pet to koopa, koopa's are turtle like creatures, Luigi has a moustache, and the maidens name is peach. In the movie, Mario and Luigi have to jump by using air stompers, the maiden's name is Daisy, Goomba's are humanoid in appearance, Koopa Troopa's drive around in cars, and there is no Bowser, just Koopa. I could go on for hours, but if you are a Mario fan, don't see this movie, STAY AWAY!!!"
2367,5,Love it,So glad I actually found it! Remember seeing it when I was little but no one else seems to have seen it. Now I have proof! And some 90s flashbacks haha
2368,3,Brings Back Old Memories. . .,"This is one of my son's favorite movies from his childhood. He has looked for it for ages and Amazon not only had it in stock but also at a great price. It may be a bit silly and goofy, but it brings back fun memories and was a great surprise stocking stuffer."
2369,1,The 90's,"You may have used the arguement that this movie was released in the 90's, 93 to be exact, and that cgi wasn't developed yet. But, Jurassic Park came out that same year, didn't use cgi, and it didn't look like crap. Did the producers just not care? Explain that. Stop trying to mkae reasons whythis movie is good, because it just isn't."
2370,3,awsome,i've also seen this movie on disney. it's weird because the caractors look and act different. like mario is bald and luigi is younger. but most of all what i thought was weird was that luigi falls in love with a dinosuar princess...
2371,3,$,Little twig powder has a better rating from Envirornmental Working Group. I like to put this on babys creases in summer.
2372,5,TGN 3,"When I first heard this CD, I loved it from the get go. The music is very hypnotic, while at the same time it infuses you with a lightening bolt of high powered trance trip'n. This makes an excellent medium for visualization (the internal kind, not the video kind), meditation, and just trancing out. Oh yeah, and dance. Dance, dance, and dance to this badboy. Even at 56 years old, I can feel the electric current going through me like I was made of copper. Did I mention it's downright sensuous too...oooeee baby, it sure'nuff is."
2373,4,Great Starting Place!,"This book is a great starting place for building a happier and fuller life. I particularly enjoy the idea of taking charge of my own life. What it didn't seem to give me was a hands on system for creating my success.If you like this book, you love ""I'm Rich Byond My Wildest Dreams. I am. I am. I am."" By Thomas L. Pauley and Penelope Pauley. It did give me that step-by-step system I was looking for."
2374,2,Not the best,"I am an avid reader so when I had an assignment in my Psychology class I was excited to see what there was to offer on Erik Erikson. I read the reviews on this book and it was promising. I bought it from Amazon.com and it came quickly, quicker then it said it would. I got through the first chapter all right but then things just went downhill. It was boring, I found it not to be well written. I normally enjoy reading about his theories and studies but this was not a great book. I would not recommend this book."
2375,2,Dissappoinment,"So was the movie chilling or frightening? The answer is no. I didn't like the movie at all. I may have seen the Exorcist too many times but I think that the movie wasn't scary enough to keep me satisfied. It wasn't a surprise that I was dissappointed after seeing it. It's absolutely not a horror movie only a good psychic thriller. I think that the fault is all Ira Levin's and his original book. Well, he has never been my favourite writer. Of course Roman Polanski is a good film director and Rosemary's Baby were a nice sightseeing into New York in the 60's. But it offered me nothing else."
2376,2,Be careful.....,"I bought this movie because I heard and read good things about it. Maybe these reviews were all written in the 60s who knows. Personally, this movie is overrated and the ending is just awful. I gave 2 stars for the simple reason that Mia Farrow is stunning."
2377,1,could not see it...,"yet i guess the movie must be great, i did not see that this dvd is only for certain countries n doesnt play here in the States.. so that kinda sucks money down the drain...."
2378,2,So....,"I do not know why this is a classic horror. It's pretty stupid. The characters are vacuous, the plot line is clice""d, the ending was retarded."
2379,5,The best supsense movie,"I saw this movie over a dozen times & enjoy it everytime. Some viewers confuse this movie as a HORROR movie, & they expect to see blood & massacre on screen. But this is certainly not Polanski style. This one keeps you in suspense until the end of the movie. If you have read the book, you appreciate how Polanski directed the movie true to the essence of the novel. The dream sequence is exactly how IRA LEVIN wrote in his book & Polanski did a good job. There are too many young audiences nowadays only look for 'blood & terror' in movies & don't appreciate such a fine film. They better off just watch the cheap flicks...."
2380,5,Movia...please....,"This movie is a masterpiece of terror & suspence & Beautifully filmed & acted.Comparisons to reality are not ""allowed"" when reviewing films of this caliber. Your reaction(though it MAY be sarcastic) is EXACT proof of it's genius! Watch it again...and this time....bask in all it's glory!"
2381,5,"""They use blood in their ritual's, and the blood that has the most power is baby's blood.""","Rosemary's Baby is satanic good fun. This is one of the most impressive horror film's I've ever seen in my life and may be my favorite horror movie of all time. Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is extremely ahead of it's time with the use of strange dream sequences, experimental cinematography and truely disturbing subject matter. Mia Farrow's performance is amazing to say the least and she has cemented her role as one of my favorite actesses of all time. Not much blood or gore in this movie but focuses on it's acting and satanic vibe to scare viewers......and it does! This is an amazing movie I recommend to anyone who has not seen it, GO BUY IT NOW!"
2382,1,The most overrated movie I have ever seen.,"Maybe I am just too young to get it, but it was not scary, not clever, and just not good.I watched the movie anticipating that it had to end well, but the ending made the movie worse.This is my first review. I just had to speak out against this movie."
2383,1,This is a classic??,"I had heard this was one of the best horror movies of all time, but my experience was that it was one of the most ridiculous and worst movies I had ever seen. I'd steer clear of this lemon. Ugh!"
2384,1,Yuck!,"Rosemary's Baby starring Mia Farrow is a total disaster. The ending is cheesy, what was Roman Polanski thinking? This horror flick is considered a classic but I think it's a muddled mess. Stay away from this turkey."
2385,1,One of the worst ever.,"This stands out in my mind as one of the biggest wastes of time I ever spent watching a movie. The name of the movie is Rosemary's Baby, the whole movie centers around awaiting the birth of the baby, and after all is said and done, we spend a lot of time being bored and not seeing the baby. Total rip-off. Save your time and money. This movie is complete garbage, regardless of the decent acting."
2386,1,Do Not Buy!,"I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead!"
2387,2,Wouldn't buy again,"We bought this coffeemaker to replace a Melitta. This unit is much taller, barely fits under the cabinets in our kitchen. The carafe is a strange design, have to turn it almost upside down to get all the liquid out. The device that forces water through the filter is narrow, so when I tried to use my re-usable filter, most of the coffee did not even get wet and made a poor pot of coffee; you have to use a paper filter. The dripper drips every time you take the pot off, even though it has a stopper device, which splashes and makes a mess. The mess is more evident because the coffeemaker is white. The coffee it makes is marginal, seems to take more coffee to make it ordinary strength. I would not recommend this coffeemaker."
2388,3,Not bad,"The Bosch 12 cup coffeemaker is good for the price of $24.00 but its plastic construction and support holding the large top lid is way to flimsy. It has broken twice. So,it functions well but I have to manually push the drip arm over the coffee filter. Next time I will spend the extra $$ to purchase a better constructed coffeemaker. I am not certain as to country of origin but this coffeemaker does NOT come from Bosch in Germany."
2389,1,Discovery Atlas Italy & Australia DOES NOT WORK,"I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You dont want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those."
2390,3,"It's good, but the narration is in French.","As indicated in my earlier review, I listened to some RealAudio segments of a few musical cuts and ordered a copy on the basis of what I heard. Unfortunately, for those who don't speak French, the NARRATIVE portion of the work, done in the original by Duke, is in French. Lyrics are in English, but ""Congo Square,"" the narrative highlight of the work (for me) is not. Caveat emptor."
2391,4,Terrible Tragedy Wonderfully Told,"Philbrick deserves the praise given to Into the Heart of the Sea. In giving a historic account of the true story that gave inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Philbrick unveils the world of the Nantucket whaling industry and the fate of one unfortunate crew. For a history book, this is a rich page-turner that is uncommon in its historic depth and compelling narrrative."
2392,3,Moderately Hype-Worthy,"Much has been written (and now shown on national TV) about Philbrick's ""In the Heart of the Sea"". This short (less than 300 page) historical account of the whaleship Essex will quickly send those who are fans of the genre back to the Andes Mountains of the early 1970s in ""Alive"" and the New England coastline where the hearty seamen from ""The Perfect Storm"" met their fate. What separates Philbrick's writing (and ultimately makes the book interesting) is the often graphic and well-researched accounting of 1820s Nantucket and the brutal lives of the whalers who made a living by going off to sea for nearly 2 years at a time. I cannot rate the book higher only because while the storyline is compelling, I did not find the story of such a unique character as to separate it from other books that deal with brutal human hardships."
2393,4,Window into a lost world,"A harrowing recount of a Nantucket whaleship's destruction in the Pacific, stoved in by an angry whale. The story inspired Melville to write Moby Dick, but's it's a gripping tale of survival all on its own. The survivors of the sinking have to make sail with their tiny skiffs across half of the Pacific Ocean.The story is grim but incredible. Philbrick wears his research lightly, although his work is thorough the research doesn't get in the way of telling the story well. It's a real window the lost world of the Nantucket whalers, their culture and life, as well as the story of men's behaviour when tested to the limits."
2394,5,Very Entertaining,This book was the first in the series and it has gotten me hooked. I am going to read all five books and will enjoy everyone.
2395,2,Of Limited Worth,"For the raw beginner wishing to gain an insight into the various methods of gluing veneer using a variety of different adhesives and their accompanying techniques, this book more than adequately serves to address this function. However, the all-important minutiae of veneering are not touched upon in any respect. The art of veneering lies not so much in the methods of gluing, but in the laying-out and trimming, particularly where the edges are concerned. An examination of any piece of pre 20th century cabinetwork will bear out this conclusion: the edges are blended with an almost surgical degree of precision to give the impression that the piece has been hewn from a solid piece of wood. This book's title should read: ""A Beginner's Guide to Gluing Veneer"" which is a far more accurate description of this book's contents and function."
2396,5,better than gas-x,take two of these compared to 4 gas-x and all is well. cheaper and less pills. this is a great product at a great price.
2397,2,Disappointing start from Conrad,"This is Joseph Conrads first novel. It deals with the conflicts between native people (Malayans) and Dutch tradesmen in the jungle of Borneo. It has some brilliant passages, but all in all it's a quite dull read."
2398,5,Excellent,"I live in Kobe, Japan. I went a concert of Kremerata Baltica last year. Fortunately I encountered this program, ""Eight Seasons"". Everybody who was there at that night is a witness of miracle. So nice play, very few left concert hall. This CD is also very impressive, I found. Kremer is also good for very classical classic. Buy one copy."
2399,1,Still a Mystery,"Anybody who is interested in learning about the beauty of Sufism should not turn to this book. This book, in fact, does not examine anything of intellectual, spiritual, or social value as related to Sufism or Islam. I have come across many books written by so-called Sufi Masters, who expound upon the complexity of the universe with inspirational imagery. This is not one of them. While books in this genre easily turn into polemics, this one surely takes the unenlightened cake. The stream of consciousness writing style lacks purpose in this setting and appears to have been an 'easy way out' of organizing a coherent book of ideology."
2400,3,"Está bien, dependiendo para qué lo quieres","Compré La Historia de la Belleza para mi tesis sobre estética. Estudio Filosofía y al momento de hacer una tesis sobre estética creo que ya tengo algo de información al respecto, por este motivo sólo por este no recomiendo el libro; es decir no lo recomiendo si lo buscas con fines académicos, al menos que quieras algo muy genérico y amplio. Sin embargo, si deseas hacer una aproximación a ""la belleza"" es libro es ua maravilla, tiene un lenguaje muy ameno, directo y simple que no complica su lectura. Además, se trata de un libro perfecto para mesita de café en la sala de casa, porque está lleno de láminas e imágenes y los textos son bastante cortos, por eso se trata del libro perfecto para pasar el tiempo mientras alguie te dejó solo esperando en la sala.La Historia de la Belleza"
2401,5,Opens up a world of possibilities,My wife wanted to get rid of the phone line connection for our Tivo. She couldn't stand the phone line snaking around the family room to the outlet. The Tivo wireless adapter took care of that issue and opened up lots of possibilities. I have now used Amazon Unbox to get a video and download it over the network to the Tivo box. Easy to do once you download the Amazon Unbox software.The adapter was easy to connect. I followed the very easy to follow instructions on the Tivo site to connect the adapter and set up the network. Make sure to follow the directions and not try to bypass something because you think you know what you are doing. I'm an electrical engineer and tried to figure it out without reading the instructions. Much easier to follow the excellent Tivo instructions.
2402,4,Great condition and prompt delivery,The product was in good condition and it came in the mail in a timely manner.
2403,4,TIVO Wireless Adapter,The TIVO adapter was easy to set up and works perfectly with my Linksys router. I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because of the industrial strength packaging that I had to saw my way through.
2404,5,Yeah for Wireless TiVo!,"Great product and price (bought from System 405, Inc). Quick shipping and worked great. Tired of paying more for your land land than TiVo service or tripping over phone wires? Easy plug and play adapter and 5 minutes to set up to run with your wireless network."
2405,5,Wireless Tivo adapter,"The Tivo Ag0100 Wireless G USB Network Adapter for Tivo is just what I needed for my Tivo. My phone jack was clear across the room and every time I wanted to connect to Tivo, I had to drag a 30 foot cord across the room and plug it in. Then I would forget to connect and Tivo would have to remind me to connect or I wouldn't get updated information for my recordings. I have a wireless laptop and I heard that tivo could connect to my broadband wireless connection with an adapter. This adapter solved all my problems. It was so easy to connect right into the USB port of the Tivo unit and I never have to think about connecting now. It's great!"
2406,3,Looks nice but !,I had been using an old wifi card that wasn't supposed to work with my Series 3 but it did. I decided to get the new adapter on advice from my son but I honestly can say that I don't see any difference at all .
2407,5,TiVo Wirless Adapter Gives Your More,"I have 3 TiVo machines each hooked to one of these; two of them are HD. Having a wireless adapter allows you the freedom of placing your TiVo machine away from a phone connection and it is a lot faster. In the case of the HDs, they are linked so you can transfer programs from upstairs to downstairs, you can pull photos/videos off your computer, and you can download movies/videos from places such as Amazon - Un-box. Can't hook up the Comcast Scientific Alanta DVR to this network, but if it wasn't almost free with digital cable, I'd have another TiVo with one of these adapters."
2408,3,Works as advertised,If you are struggling with another brand of wireless adapter for your Tivo do yourself a favor and get this one. This item deserves 5 stars for usability but I gave it three because it's a shame Tivo almost forces you to use their propriety adapter when there are dozens of other cheaper brands that work with most all wireless products.
2409,5,Absolutely Perfect!,"After I had my landline disconnected and began using my cell phone, I thought my TiVo would be useless. I tried to hook it up wirelessly with a linksys adapter and it didn't work. With a lot of reservations, I ordered TiVo AG0100. Since I'm about as far from a computer geek as you can get, I was praying it wouldn't take me weeks to figure out how to use it. The day it arrived I took a deep breath and plugged it into the back of the TiVo. Immediately, I got the prompt that a wireless connection had been detected. From there, all I had to do was enter the network name and encryption key. The entire process took me less than ten minutes, and now I have my TiVo back! One caveat; I did have to restart my TiVo afterward, but I think it was because I'd let the information run out before my AG0100 arrived. I love this adapter!"
2410,4,Ease of Use!!,"TIVO locked upon install, but chatted with tech support and they provided me a code to get it unlocked. Other than that, operates well, no complaints. Would recommend if you want to have a TIVO set up without having a bunch of ethernet cables ran to it. Can attest that this DOES work with TIVO HD Premiere!! Don't spend extra on the 'G' unless you absolutely want to, this works just fine!!!"
2411,5,Excellent Product,"Excellent product. If you are using your tivo through a telephone cord and have wireless in your home, you should definitely by this and switch. (I did not rate customer service because I have had no problems.)"
2412,5,Gets the job done,It works as advertised. It is unfortunate that Tivo doesn't support as many G class wireless adapters as it did with B. I'm hoping that they come out with an inexpensive 802.11N adapter so I can transfer shows to and from my Tivo at better rates.
2413,3,Works OK,"I love the functionality that this device gives the tivo. Being able to transfer recordings to the tivo is great. I just feel that it should be faster than it is, though I'm not sure if the lag in the menus is due to this device or it's just the tivo. Also, it seems to lose connection to my LAN occasionally and needs to be resetup, not sure why. Being able to download movies from Amazon, cheaply and easily, is the biggest bonus in my opinion. I definitely recommend the product, just wish that the tivo menus were a bit more responsive and that it was solid with the network."
2414,5,Great upgrade to our system,"We have 2 series 2 tivo DVRa in seprate rooms. We were not ready to upgrade our boxes, but the wireless adadapters were a less expensive upgrade we decided to try. The adapters allow us to share shows between the 2 DVRs and our computer with the software from TIVO. Now we can tape different shows on each, but watch them wherever we want.Glad we did it. Easy to set up, just plug them in and enter the wi-fi password. took about 5 minutes."
2415,5,Flawless for N Router,"I purchased this after upgrading to a ""N"" router. The wireless adapter I had for Tivo no longer worked. This was a flawless installation and has worked perfectly in the month since I have used it."
2416,4,Big Improvement over Phone line,"We purchased this because we were tired of Tivo taking over our home phone line. This adapter was very easy to install, and within 10 minutes it was programmed and ready to go. Very pleased with the product and delivery."
2417,3,"Works, but could be better","I have it hooked up to my Tivo in the living room and I get between 50-58% signal strength. Not great considering my laptop in the same room gets about 80-90% signal strength. Tivo's suggestion of getting the adapter closer to my wireless router is a joke. The reason I have this is so they can be apart. If they were closer, I would just use a network cable."
2418,5,Great product,"It was very easy to install the Tivo Wireless G Usb Network adapter. I did have some problems hooking it up to the wireless, but that was my fault. It is now working great. It is so small most do not even see it."
2419,5,This works great,Quick delivery on these 2 wireless adapters let us install and get our TIVO up and running in no time. These adapters allows our two tivo's to basically talk to each other. We can watch what is recording on one can be view on the other. Great reception as well. The TIVO people will walk you thru installation if necessary.
2420,5,Superb,This product works great and we are happy to be able to use TIVO again. We did not have a phone line because of using cell phones. This brought this capability back to us. We are very happy. THANKS!
2421,5,Nice adapter!,"The adapter arrived quickly and effortlessly and just like that, poof! our Tivo was wireless. It's a wondrous thing, this Tivo Wireless adapter.I highly recommend it. If you have Tivo."
2422,5,TiVo Wireless Adapter Works Great,I have been using TiVo with the TiVo Wireless USB Network Adapter for several months now and I haven't had any issues with this device. I was pleased to see the device work right from the start. I just plugged it in and TiVo recognized the device and started communicating with the TiVo servers.
2423,5,Works Perfect!,Works perfectly with our new HD Tivo. Very easy to set-up and use. And a great price on Amazon.com
2424,3,ok,"All things considered, it's okay. It was a pain in the rear to set up. It doesn't seem to work as well as it could, but it basically does the job."
2425,2,Doesn't work with Tivo Basic,"This item will not work with Tivo Basic (the Tivo service included on some Pioneer and Toshiba boxes). We bought a Pioneer 810H several years ago that included Tivo. This is Tivo Basic and this item requires Tivo Plus. You do not have a Media Access Key if you have Tivo Basic, which is required to get this to work. Unfortunately, Tivo Plus is an upgrade to Basic, so it costs extra. Since we already paid a lot for the box (equal to a lifetime membership), we didn't want to do that again and sent it back, so I can't really attest to its functionality or ease of use (although it was a huge pain to figure out why we didn't have a MAK...that took some serious googling since they don't make our box anymore)."
2426,4,The only adapter that works with Series 3 TiVo,"I just got a TiVo Series 3, and hoped to use my Linksys USB adapter to connect to the network. It didn't happen. TiVo has programmed the new boxes to only accept their adapter (a message pops up to let you know this when you try to plug anything else in.I was going to just hardwire it, but relented and bought the TiVo adapter. Plugged it in and it fired right up. I also understand this adapter does some of the proceesing for the TiVo, so there is some benefit to using it over another brand (if you have a Series 2, which will accept other adapters).So I give it high marks for ease of use and performance, but deducted for crippling the Series 3 to force me to use it, and price.I don't have WEP enabled yet, but doubt it will be a problem when I do. I use a Linksys WRT-54g router.If you don't want to mess around getting your TiVo to connect through your wireless network connection, this is the way to do it."
2427,4,"Interesting, but slow","The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned."
2428,2,A mash of cobbled coincidences,"This book is similar to a Dickens novel in that it seeks not to reach perfection, but to please its audience at the time. Like Dickens, it is very dry and filled with hard to believe coincidences that make the story hard to swallow. Still, Hardy paints a very lively, realistic and flowing impression of the English countryside in the early days, before the industrial revolution. I would recommend this only if you are obsessed with Hardy, if you have run out of books to read (try Fifth Business by Robertson Davies) or if you are forced to read this as a part of some course."
2429,1,Excruciatingly Boring,"I began reading this novel since it has such a great reputation as being a ""classic."" However, after reading well over a hundred pages, the book failed to keep my attention in the least bit. The plot is weak and pathetic, and the characters are too one-dimensional. Although it may pick up later, it certainly is not worth it."
2430,2,Chapter Missing,"Even though it is free, and I appreciate that, there was about a chapter missing. I would suggest this either be fixed, or the book removed from sale."
2431,1,missing most of chapter 20,Luckily I have the physical book too so was able to read the missing bit. Suggest you try another kindle version.
2432,1,Waste of paper,"I recently had to read this book as part of my English GCSE and I can honestly say that much paper has been wasted and our trees are being destroyed to churn out a book, which is quite frankly absolutly awfull. I also am very glad that I was not around to ever meet Thomas Hardy as from this book it sounds to me that he may well of been a manic depresent, also in most, if not all, of his other books they all end in a very sad a depressing way. Hardy describes Henchard as 'dogged' and i feel if you want to read this you too will have to be dogged and determind to start and finish this book."
2433,2,Dubious creation,"There is already a book very similar to this one about a dog's adventure in Paris. Findley took credit,with the true author's approval however, for this book that John Demires actually entirely wrote. The book was indeed entertaining and it gave a good overview of many of New Orleans' novel attractions."
2434,4,Love this album,"I really am glad to have found this album on Amazon for such a reasonable price. My favorite Songs are #Let Me Know, # Stupid and # Let's Chill... I love her voice!"
2435,3,Refreshing Perspective on Faith,"An intelligent critical analysis of the New Testament, particularly the four gospels. Gives thoughtful seekers the freedom to come to faith without having to abandon their intelligence. Author suggests it is not necessary to take every story in the gospels literally in order to learn the important lessons or to come to know Jesus as the Savior."
2436,5,Rare Glow Fribee Delivered Fast,"I live in a small town with the local Wal-Mart as the 'get all' store. Yea, like they are classy enough to carry Whamo glow frisbees. Leave it to AMAZON to direct me to this exact Model Frisbee. SO easy on checkout...No problems and my son is starting to understand how to fly a frisbee! Thanks much you guys!"
2437,1,Don't Bother,"Bought this for my aging father-in-law, he couldn't read it, said it was too complicated, and he already knew how to play pinochle so this book was pretty much a bomb. Don't waste your money."
2438,1,Very boring film....,"I'm a huge Nirvana fan. I got this movie because I figured it might be good......Well.....it's ""based"" on Kurt but honestly to me it didn't make any sence at all..... I know everything there is to know about Kurt.....I didn't like this movie one bit... It bored me to death......on his final days no one knew where he was so yeah....those friends of his didn't exist.....Well. For all you Nirvana/Kurt fans don't buy this movie. If you like Gus Van Sant I guess you could get this movie.....are all his movies this boring?"
2439,1,The worst movie Ive every seen,"This movie was the worst movie Ive ever seen, Waste of 90 mins of time. I wish I could get paid for the time I wasted watching it.And no I ""get It""It is not art."
2440,2,BEWARE!!!,"This was a good movie from an artistic perspective, like what everyone else said so far (very very slow, quiet etc.). However only one person mentioned the fact that there is a gay scene. There is a gay scene! By gay scene I mean two guys making-out on a bed.I I guess it could be worse, but (being hetero) I had a hard time accepting it's connection to Kurt Cobain. I Just have to make sure you all know what you're getting in to."
2441,4,The Pearl Jam Lion sucks...not Pearl jam,"Let's clarify something...one, this is supposed to be reviews of the movie, not the merits of two great bands. Second, why in hell a Pearl Jam fan would jump up and say ""Cobain is overrated"" is beyond me...it makes other Pearl Jam fans look like morons. Both bands have their supporters and their detractors, but no one can take away from the fact that they were both very different, very talented, and only have the ""Seattle stigma"" to connect them. People seem to forget near the end of Cobain's life that both Cobain and Eddie Vedder had a mutual respect for each other, only able to occur after both of them dropped their pretenses and actually paid attention and learned what the other was really doing. Fans could stand to do the same and make their heroes, dead or alive, proud."
2442,1,Dreadful,"The _not_ Cobain character rambles, mumbles, stutters, attempts to write music and finally manages to kill himself, about five minutes before I was ready to kill myself.Avoid."
2443,4,On A Plain and I Can't Complain,"This movie has received mixed reviews and I can understand why. Those expecting something similar to ""The Doors"", ""Sid and Nancy"" or ""24 Hour Party People"" will be extremely disappointed. However, those expecting nothing at all may actually find themselves intrigued by this stunning piece of ""art on film"". The film is beautifully shot. The vibrant colors in many scenes contrast the feeling of sadness and loneliness conveyed by the main character, Blake. I was very impressed by this film and it stayed with me for many days after my initial viewing. That is when I realized that ""Last Days"" was not a MOVIE, but rather, a work of art. I know that may sound kind of dumb but it really felt like I had just viewed a painting at an art museum or something. I've never experienced that before. So I guess the question is: Was it worth the time viewing this ""motion picture art"" for 2 hours? My answer: Absolutely."
2444,2,neck harness - poor design,"Neck harness is a great addition to the gym equipment, however, this specific one is less than comfortable. This harness is the first one I tried so I am not sure how it compares with others on the market."
2445,5,Finally!,"Finally a head harness that is meant to hold some weight!very sturdy construction, padded and adjustable!"
2446,3,Intruder in the Dust Review,"I have a Literature exam tomorrow - kind of a final- and this is one of the books included. I never got past chapter 2 but I really wish I had! I just couldn't keep up with it but I'm pretty sure that if I understood what I was reading I would have enjoyed it very much. The sentences are extremely long and by the time you get to the end of one, you don't even know what you read. I think that Faulkner's ""stream of conciousness"" writing is very interesting - you need to read it as if you were having a conversation with Faulker and he's telling you the story and he's jumping all over the place. I SHOULD TAKE MY OWN ADVICE...BUT ANYWAY GIVE IT A CHANCE!"
2447,5,"Riveting story, great characterization, vibrant.","For everyone that loves John Grisham, and his legal thrillers.You really owe it to yourself to read Faulkner. Once you capturehis rant, and learn to wade through his long sentences-you willbe glued to this novel. His writing pattern and imagery areaddictive, and you will want to learn more about him and otherMississippi writers like Larry Brown, and Barry Hannah--notthe millionaire from Oxford."
2448,1,Bites,"I hated this book. William Faulkner has to be the poorest excuse for a writer that ever lived. I got so tired of his pages long sentences and parentheticals within parentheticals within sentences within parentheticals (I wish I were making this up). To make matters worse, sometimes his parentheticals were so long, I forgot what preceded it! And let's not forget his made-up words (uninsatiable? ever hear of a dictionary, Will? IT'S NOT IN THERE!) This book bites, HARD. And let's face it, if he were alive today, no way would anyone with a brain publish this garbage. At least not without some serious editing."
2449,1,Long sentences that are extremely confusing.,"Bad book overall, only interesting about the themes of discrimination"
2450,4,about the long sentences...,"he purposely made the sentences long like that for a reason. through his style, he was trying to show you the mindset of people in the South after World War 2. If you don't understand why he made that choice, don't go off saying that it's just poor writing, you are making yourself sound stupid like that."
2451,3,This book makes you think and THINK a lot !!!,"My opinion is that this book was overly long and boring. The ideas and the narratives are difficult to understand. Of course, the book is an enticing novel or racism in the south. Of couse what the hell do I know? I am 16 years old."
2452,5,Compelling Reading,"Did you ever wonder about the synchronicities in your life? Ever look at the clock only to see it say 11:11, again and again? Maybe these are hints to your connection with the universe and the spirits that inhabit it. Pay attention and grab a copy of this book. George Barnard has paid attention and has been working in the service of the 1,111 spirit guardians that are the permanent residents of this planet and these are his stories. Read this book and then think about your own opportunities.Something's happening hereWhat it is ain't exactly clear-Buffalo Springfield-"
2453,2,"okay, but not great","I used this to study for the recertification exam in the summer of '09. I passed the exam, but I'm not sure how much this book helped. It focused a lot of questions on certain diseases that were not on the exam, and some diseases that were hit multiple times on the exam were never mentioned in the book. Also, like other reviewers have mentioned, there are numerous mistakes and dated practice guidelines in the book. If I had to do it over again, I would try a different book."
2454,1,too many errors! How can I trust what I am studying!,"I have been out of medicine for 5 years and am reviewing to re-enter practice. I am only on question #145 but have come across 6-10 errors- mainly things that are contradicting previous answers. Many times I am double-checking answers on up to date.Otherwise, I guess the material is fine, but really for me personally, it is intolerable to have so many errors. Studying should NOT induce extra anxiety!!I have stopped using this book and just ordered Swanson's 6th edition and one other resource as well."
2455,1,Errors. Repetitive questions. Some out-of-date answers.,"I threw it away after 100 pages. Spend the $300+ on Core Content. (I've no financial relationship with them.) Also, I used the Kaplan Master the Boards for Int Med and I'm getting the one for Peds for my ABFM exam."
2456,3,"Helpful, but certainly not well edited.",I just finished the book. I prefer to do questions when studying for boards. It is a good book to use to study just prior to the boards and helps get you in the mind set of thinking in terms of questions.My biggest gripe about the book is that some of the answers were just plain wrong...and the explanations that were given to substantiate the wrong answers contradicted the answers. There were some typos as well. Having some noticeably wrong answers does not give me a whole lot of confidence about the other answers that I was learning from.Best of luck.
2457,5,Bond...Brilliant!,"Another outstanding DVD production. This one filled with more music, but the lighting for the finale is poor. Great buy!"
2458,2,Not My Style,"I got interested in this group as I was looking at a U-Tube video that utilized the song ""Lullaby"" from the Bond Classified album as back-drop music. I was so mesmerized by the tune I bought every Bond album there was available as well as this Live video. Unfortunately, for me - all the other songs on all the other albums were nothing like the ""Lullaby"" song and quite honestly, I threw everything else in the trash. This is not to say that the group plays bad music or are untalented in any respect...This type of Techno-Symphony is just not my speed...I prefer soft rock as opposed to this."
2459,2,Get's boring,"What's not to like about four hot chicks shaking their bottoms playing classical music? ""Victory"", the song you probably heard in the watch commercial is by far their best song. All the others are not so great. Unfortunately, it gets tiresome after a while, the bottom-shaking and classical music - definitely not something that will stay with us for a while."
2460,1,eye/ear catching,"well i as well saw/heared the DVD playing at a local electronic store and was tempted to buy it.after the first time playing it i was dissapointed to find only a couple notes worthy of listenign to.after the 2nd round the dvd became old.the impressions looked fake and the energy everybodys talking about somehow didnt show on my DVD.to sum it up, i expected something new and exciting and i found an early 80`s like band playing on a cheap movie.not really recomended."
2461,1,FAKE,"very disapointed in this DVD!it is not live! they are very obviously faking playing to a recordingthat being said, I enjoy the cds and will probably buy future releases...but after watching the dvd, it makes me wonder if there is a Milli Vanilli thing going on here"
2462,2,"FACTS good, authors OPINION on religion(s) unnecessary","Edward Chiera presented wonderful information on his research of ancient civilizations. Very easy to read for Jr. High students. However, his personal comments on religion(s) was just that, his personal comments, nothing factual. Recommeded reading for students with religious chapters omitted."
2463,5,A wonderful CD,This is a wonderful CD from Nick Kemp who studied with Richard Bandler the creator of NLP.The CD takes the listener on a magical ride into deep relaxation and altered states and produces a great sense of well being. The music is fantastic and the intricate use of hypnosis makes this an important product for students of NLP and hypnosis.
2464,2,used to be good,"I have lots of these , using them almost daily as underware . my first pair having purchased at least 6 years ago. my two most recent purchases of these has yielded a variety of quality and sizes . seems like they are being made in multiple overseas sweet shops with little quality control . won't be buying again"
2465,5,The original accept no substitute!,These are amazing! My workouts are some much better with these! Support galore yet pliant for easy movement! The fabric formula is an Uner Armour exclusive! Yes! It matters. Athletes rejoice in total support! Way recommended!
2466,5,great product,My husband loves theses. They fit great and get the job done.The blue that I ordered for him is a really nice solid color.
2467,5,"Great Quality, Quick Shipping",Great for running and staying cool. I have a pair of Starter brand compression shorts that are awful in comparison to these.
2468,5,Just what he wanted,"I purchased this for my partner. It is exactly what he wanted. He really loves them! Very comfortable, excellent fit, perfect for workouts."
2469,4,I like 'em,"I bought one pair of these and one pair of Road Runner Sports Velocity compression shorts to compare for running. I thought the UA pair was going to feel very hot, as the material is thick compared to other brands (Nike, RRS, etc). These must do a great job wicking away moisture, because they felt very comfortable on a 20 mile run, and not hot like others in comparison. There is a reason you see UA products everywhere, they are really quality goods. I'll be wearing these next weekend for a marathon, if that tells you the level of confidence and comfort (no chafing with these!) I have in this product. Would give 5 stars, but I've got to own them a bit longer before I go all in."
2470,4,"Disappointed initially, but still worthwhile","When I purchased these, I was thought they had a pad in the crotch area. I wanted to use them for cycling. Well, they don't have a pad and even worse there is a seam running right through the center. This is usually a bad thing for me because it can cause chaffing in a place that can be very uncomfortable. However, I decided to use these shorts anyways to see what would happen. Fortunately, they didn't chafe me. I do find them to be a bit tighter than I expected as well, but again it ultimately doesn't cause any issues. Therefore, I have to say that it was a good deal considering the price difference between these and the ones that cost significantly more but have a pad."
2471,5,Great product!,"The product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted. In the past, these shorts have been great quality and have lasted much longer than other brands I have tried."
2472,5,HOKEY BUT SATISFYING,.....Somewhat dated and a little syrupy but if you like to be entertained the Gaynor/March original is superior to the remakes with Garland/Mason and Streisand/Kristophern.
2473,2,Tasted awful and did not really work for me,"I was referred to this product by a lactation consultant who swore by it. I had gone back to work a few weeks prior and my supply was dwindling severly due to the pump not being nearly as efficient as my little man. I began taking far more than the recommended dose of the More Milk Plus, in an effort to really up my supply. The product tasted really nasty, even when mixed with a strong tasting drink and I did not see any major difference in my supply."
2474,2,Casey at the Bat,"One of the book covers was torn and covered with a black substance. It was unsuitable to gift to the intended recipient. I had to obtain another book locally. I tried to contact Horizon Books via telephone, but never got an answer. I would appreciate a replacement copy!"
2475,5,Wonderful reading for all guitar enthuiasts.,"In The PRS Guitar Book, Dave Burrluck describes in detail the evolution of PRS Guitars, the renowned company founded by expert guitar maker Paul Reed Smith in 1985. The PRS Guitar Book showcases every artistic and technical facet of these exquisite instruments that sold to an enthusiasts clientele for $2000 and up. The PRS Guitar Book is enhanced with lavish color photography, anecdotes and reminiscences from Smith, famous guitarists, and PRS employees, collectors and fans. The PRS Guitar Book is highly recommended, wonderful reading for all serious guitar enthusiasts, professional or amateur."
2476,2,OK but not great,"If you are going to spend the money on a book regarding spearfishing, spend the extra money for ""Bluewater Hunting and Freediving"" by Terry Maas. It has much more info that this book.This book is elementary at best."
2477,1,Save your money,"Although this book has some decent pictures the writing and analysis is below average. Writer appears more interested in underwater photography. His coverage of spearguns borders on the flimsy. He appears to have little actual experience in this area. Book is only 133 pages. 1. I saw no pictures of author with fish. 2. Written in third party format. Appears to be commercial diver or instructor. 3. Speargun coverage lightweight, knowledge of powerheads insufficient. Nothing on shark defense. 4. Seems to condone not using safeties on guns. 5. Does not use own equipment in book but refers to borrowed spearguns, etc.. 6. Appears to own little or none of his own spearing equipment. Written from the reporter, photographer point of view. I recommend looking elsewhere."
2478,4,quite good,fairly basic but fundamental intro to spearfishing with a few gems often missed in other more 'advanced' books.worth having in your 'spearo' collection.
2479,3,Spearfishing for Skin and Scuba Divers,"Pretty good, a little dated but gives you most of the info you'll need to get started."
2480,5,Great book for Physiotheraby Board exam,"I find this book very helpful. It's very organized, concise and well explained. It is a good source of review along with you.I am highly recommending this book to anyone aspiring for more knowledge in the exam."
2481,2,Not very good,"We own every European travel book that exists. I can honestly say that this one is by far the worst one I have seen, hands down. The coverage of accommodations is sparse and only includes extraordinarily expensive hotels, for the most part, and the dining recommendations are little better. There are no unique tips in this guide and it really covers 6 cities, and not very comprehensively. I give an extra star for making the attempt to write a kids travel guide, since they are not common."
2482,1,Boring,I read a lot of historical fiction. This is perhaps the third novel in the last 10 years that I could not finish because it was so slow. I forced myself to 250 or 270 pages but the story drags on.Its simply boring.
2483,3,"""My Opinion""",(...) AND I WEAR A LOT OF FILA'S I HAVE WORN FILA'S SINCE I STARTED WALKING AND NOW I HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME BB84 MID IN LADIES I WOULD LOVE TO PURCHASE A PAIR OF PINK/WHITE/BLACK FILA'S. WHERE I LIVE I HAVE SEEN THE FILA TRUCK AND WITH THESE SPECIFIC PAIR OF SHOES ON IT AND I SAID TO MYSELF OUT OF ALL THE FILA'S I'VE WORN I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY OF THESE AND I HAVE TO HAVE A PAIR OF THEM.SO THIS IS MY OPINION THAT IF YOU ALL HAVEN'T MADE ANY OF THEM OR HAVE EVER SENT ANY TO MY STATE I THINK YOU SHOULD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC COLOR EVERY WHERE I GO AND PEOLPE REALLY SAID THEY WOULD BUY THEM TO ONLY IF YOU SOLD THEM OR PUT THEM ON THE INTERNET SO IF YOU CAN COULD YOU PLEASE SEND ME A E-MAIL BACK FOR I COULD PURCHASE THESE SHOES OR COULD YOU PLEASE CONSIDER MAKING THESE COLOR OF SHOE SO PLENTY OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS LIKE ME COULD CONTINUE PURCHASING YOUR PRODUCT.THANK YOU
2484,4,"Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck","The story took place in Soledad, California during the Great Depression. There were two migrant workers mentioned in this book, George and Lennie. They were best friends. Their relationship symbolizes strong vs. weak. One of them always causes the other trouble. You will think the weak one always causes strong trouble right? But the truth is, the strong guy(Lennie) always causes the weak(George) trouble. Why was that? First Lennie cause tiny problems, then bigger and finally the biggest trouble. Now what and how should the weak one(George) help or save his best friend?I give the rate of 4 stars to this book. It's a great book for love, friendship and at a loss as what to do. The theme of this book is sometimes friends have to force themselves do something that he/she doesn't want to. I recommend this book to those young children and adults who have been lost as to what to do."
2485,4,A Simple Read,"Of Mice and Men was about the best book I have ever read. It's a story of George and Lenny, two men that have not much more than each other. It's a captivating book, but not one to read if you like exciting, happily ever after endings. John Steinbeck is not that kind of writer. Everything that happens in the book is foreshadowed, and by the end it has you saying, ""Oh, that's why he wrote whate he wrote in the beginning."" It's a great book and a must read for high school students."
2486,4,"Review of ""of mice and Men""","""Of Mice and Men"" writen by John Steinbeek is a book which narrates during the great depression era, the relationship of two men among the indifference of the world around them.Those are George -described as a small and quick and dark of face- and Lennie -a very strong and tall guy who has the mind of a young child.As they travel together, Lennie goes getting them into trables. That's why they had to move form Weed to Soledad. They only want to reach their dream, to get a own place where yo live, but Lennie's actions get him into a trable which has awful and irrepable consequences that affect not only himself and George but also other characters of the story.This is a story of loneliness, frienship, loyalty and corage."
2487,4,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men is about two friends that are on a journey together. Lennie is a big man that is strong, and has memeory problems. George watches over Lennie and cares for him. They aren't related, just friends. Lennie likes to pet soft things, and often leads him to trouble.They got ran out of their old town because of something Lennie did. Now they are trying to get a new job working on a farm, in hopes of geting enough money to get their own farm. George convinces Lennie to work hard and try not to get in trouble. George tells Lennie he can tend the rabbits when the get the farm, as motivation.Read this book and find out what happens to George and Lennie."
2488,4,Of Mice and Men,"Of Mice and Men, written during the great depression, explains, in beautiful detail, the life of two homless men. The book takes place on a ranch in Soledad, California. George and Lennie are the main characters. These two homeless men travel around the United States looking for work. They find it in Soledad. George is small and has all the brains bteween the two friends, Lennie is tal and slow but ""One hell of a strong worker,"" according to George. I canit say anymore. They dream of making enough money at this ranch and buy a small plot of land with a small house on it. It's a short book with only one hundered and eighteen pages. It is one of the best classic,s I've ever read, (the others being The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series.) The main and supporting characters are George and Lennie, Slim, Crooks, Curley, Curley's Wife (she doesn't have a name), Carlson, and Candy. I'm not going to tell the end but I will say that it is quite depressing, though a great book."
2489,1,The REAL Of Mice and men,"Now, then:Of Mice and Men Is one of the worst books I have ever read. Let me count the ways:1) It has immeasuably two dimensional chacters. Steinbeck stays so close to the archetypal ""strong man"" ""seedy guy"" ""angry little guy"" ""seductive wife"" its disgusting. he even has a token black guy! Absurd.2) An equally two-dimensional plot. Steinbeck's unbearable heavy handedness in getting his all important ""moral"" across completely crushes out any vestige of meaningful charcterization or subtext.3) The ending. No, I'm not about to say ""ew!"" What i will say is that thats what he WANTS you to think. He wants you to put down this book and ""realzie the impossibility the america dream, and the cutthroat nature of humans in general."" The problem with this conclusion is the entire book is completely contrived! The most absurd confluence of cicumstances that could possible occur come togethr in this book. its all crap.There. Just in case you missed it...[...]"
2490,5,A simple tale for the ages,"An outstanding, chilling, and thought provoking book that helped to shape my thought processes as an adolescent when I read the book for the first time, Of Mice and Men is Steinbeck's most succinct piece. A delicacy I enjoyed again this past summer, its messages change, its characters evolve, and its definitions are redefined with a readers age and experience.Regardless, this book is a classic and a staple for any fan of literature."
2491,5,All time classic-fast read,"I was on a ""classic"" book binge this summer. This was the last on my list and it was the perfect way to wind down after books like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""The Bell Jar""."
2492,5,book,This item arrived on time and it was just as described! Highly recommended and great to do business with! Thanks.
2493,5,a good book,I am from BLA high school in the bronx and I thank my teacher MS. Solomon for giving us this book to read. This book tells the story of true friends and how hard it was during the great depression. From this book I have learned that sometimes you just got to do what is best for you and your friend. This book always has a new surprise. The author uses symbolism and foreshadowing to tell the story. As the story goes on the better it gets. I have read this book twice and I can just keep reading it over and over because it tells such good details and information. Reading this book you will feel as if you were there because the action never ends you will keep being surprised until the last sentence of the book.
2494,5,"Tell it again, George . . .","It's easy to see why Steinbeck's classic has been the subject of study for so many years; it's a master-class of literary form. Clean prose and simple storytelling, no added unnecessarys. Even the metaphor is unfussy.But Steinbeck's true gift lies in characterisation and his understanding of dialogue. When his characters speak and act they betray themselves for who they are. The reader listens and sees, gleans a past from the characters' voices and gestures. The power of the novel comes from the intimacy the reader has with these characters, and it's a testament to Steinbeck that in such a short book he reveals so much.Everyone should meet Lennie and George at least once, and if you do, you'll never forget them."
2495,5,Classic,"I accidentally ordered this. The day it arrived, I spent the afternoon enthralled by Steinbeck's writing and his unique view of the world. ""East of Eden"" is one of my very favorite books and I don't really know why I've never read ""Of Mice and Men"" before. I vaguely remember seeing it as a play while I was in high school.A story about two men working together to attain their own version of the American Dream, it brings up many ethical questions and can lead to some interesting discussion and thought.Excellent. I no longer have to wonder why it is a classic."
2496,3,Great Book to read for English class,"This book is a great book to read and do a project on for a LA class, mostly honors LA, 8th grade and upto HS. What makes it so good is the fact that the plotline is interesting, even if it does get thrown away in a suprise ending, it is intresting to read about until that point. It is short, you can read it in 1-2 days, and LA teachers love it because it is one of those novels that gets you to think 'critically'. It's a win-win-win. Great story for your entertainment, short if you are short on time, and gets you to think. It actully contains some pretty heavy stuff in a little package."
2497,3,Steinbeck's worse....???,Steinbeck himself thought this book was most likely his worst workings.The story line is quite intresting and humorous from time to time.Though its plagued with wordiness and underdeveloped characters.The over all message of the book is excellent and is portrayed as such.
2498,4,This book was pretty good,"I had to read this book for school, so at first I didn't appreciate it. Now, after I finished it, I think it is a great book. I recommend this book to others."
2499,4,Of Mice and Men,"Stienbeck's ""Of Mice and Men"" was a prime novel, filled with important issues and underlying motives. There were many forshadowing events that led up to the (to me) unexpected ending.The two charactors, George and Lennie, are developed into astounding realisim. From the descisons and the thought patterns to thier problems and people skills the two men bloom into fenominal people.I enjoyed this novel because it constantly had me reading inbetween the lines. It also captured my attention with its realisem."
2500,4,Great book,"I enjoyed reading this novel. It taught the true meaning of a friendship. It was the story of a dream that was unreachable, but George kept the dream alive for Lennie, until he was forced to...nevermind I won't tell the ending. Read it, the ending id great!"
2501,2,of mice and men,"The story is about two gays that are looking for any job. All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of bad and good things. They always help and got each other,""I got you, you got me""said George, one of the principal characters, and this shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the future. Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they finally lived and work."
2502,3,Good and Bad,"I thought this book was good except for the weird ending, Curley's wife dying and Lennie, that was strange."
2503,4,slow mice. fast one gets the cheese,"a book that made me put tear stains on the book.About a big stupid man and a quick sharp-witted guy,looking for a good, happy way to live.Both have ambitions for a farm, except it keeps on slipping away from their grasp.It's great, but I gave it 4 stars.I have a feeling that about 1 out of 3rd of the book are details explaining the world around them.Goes veeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry slow."
2504,4,Coolio,"'Merica done right--in a righteous book. And now, because I need a few more words to finish the review, blah."
2505,3,Not as good as The Grapes of Wrath,"“Of Mice and Men” tells the story of two friends who wander from ranch to ranch to make money, and hopefully, own their own farm someday. The only Achilles’ heel in this plan is Lenny, a giant of a man with the mind of a child, who tends to get in trouble although he is full of good intentions.“Of Mice and Men” has similar social criticisms to “The Grapes of Wrath”, also written by John Steinbeck. I am aware it was published before “The Grapes of Wrath”, but still I recommend reading “The Grapes of Wrath” which is a better version of “Of Mice and Men.” The plot and characters are more developed, and the message behind it is deeper. In my opinion, “The Grapes of Wrath” is better in every aspect."
2506,3,Jp the koolest kat,"I think the book was an ok book to read if it is for sfa, and you have to read it in a certain amout of time. It is very short and i think it was to easy to read for an 8th grader. It had a lot of swears in it so you can say them out loud in class and you wont get in troble. I think the worst part in the book is when Lennnie dies. I thought Lennie was funny and he did not desevre to die. And i also did not like how the book ended so soon."
2507,3,Kris-Tina A. and Sara W.,"Confusing, yet satisfying, ""Of Mice And Men"" by John Steinbeck offers some depressing surprises. The story revolves around George, a small, well-defined man, and Lennie, a large, mentally retarded man. Together, they run from authorities from ranch to ranch with a quest for a ranch of their own. The theme of this slightly disturbing novel was lonliness. Two other themes of this novel was violence and dreams. Even though it may seem like George doesn't care about Lennie when he verbally abuses him but he really does. Two conficts in the novel are Lennie's petting problem and George's inner problems. Lennie constantly finds trouble and his angelic mind wont let him see why. George can't really help him out of it though, he taught him all he knows. At the end ""Of Mice And Men"" even though it seems horrible, George does what is best for Lennie."
2508,3,"Brilliant Author, Mediocre Novel.....","Let me make a declaration: John Steinbeck was a genius and a brilliant writer; however, with ""Of Mice and Men"" he simply fell short. Although it was extremely well-written in Steinbeck's signature simple style, the novel was just too brief for the plot resolve itself. The resolution seemed forced and rushed. Despite this, Steinbeck did fit in an amazing amount of character development in just over one-hundred pages. I would recommend ""The Grapes of Wrath"" over ""Of Mice and Men."" I would also strongly urge readers to shy away from ""The Red Pony"" and ""The Pearl,"" also by John Steinbeck. READ ""THE GRAPES OF WRATH"" INSTEAD!"
2509,5,A beautiful and compelling novel,"An unforgettable, highly moving story with much to say about love, yearning, and loss. So powerful and affecting, it is a crime that some schools keep the book from teenagers who would undoubtedly find the story hugely important and compelling. The book is a subtle, but very powerful indictment of predjudice and mistreatment of the weak. For that reason alone,the book should be celebrated and taught regularly in our schools. A great classic."
2510,4,Touching and very well written story,"I think this is an excellent story which is very thought provoking. It's a tale of two unlikely partners who are in pursuit of their American dream. The dream ends tragically for many of the characters, who are all very different yet very similar in predicament. I'ts not long, but I'd definitely recommend this book."
2511,1,Over Priced,"Despite being a very well writen work, this ebook is over priced for the length and content. I have a paper copy sitting next to me, and even it is less expensive! I am disappointed."
2512,5,HILARIOUS!,"This book was absolutely hilarious, by far the funniest book i've ever read! It's a barrel of laughs with a new surprise around every corner! I don't like to give away the end of books, but I just can't help myself! The part when they fly to Paris, and that crazy stuardess! I know, I know, i laughed my fanny off! If you're looking for laughs, this is definately it! Enjoy!"
2513,4,Of MIce and Men,The book has great story about how two men with very different personaliltes get along. They travel together trying to earn enough moeny to live out their dream. It shows how no matter what happens they have a friendship which connects them in some way. They have a wonderful frienship and stand by each other. Lennie is not the brightest man and can be a little aggrivating but no matter what George is there to help and protect him.
2514,5,Of Mice and Men,"George and Lennie are best friend. George is a small guy but he has a quick mind and is dark of face. Lennie is a huge man, and has the mind of a young child. They feel lonely. They need each other. they work togeter and begin their dream in the bunkhouse. Those days, some conflicts happen in this little house. And then, George and Lennie need to face these problems.I love this book. The book is great as welll. Because it completely decribes everybody. I can see the hardship of their lives. Sometimes you have no choice. I learned something from this book. What happens in the bunkhouse? How do george and lennie face their problem? You will only find out if You read it! I think you can learn something fromthis book too."
2515,3,"SHORT AND SWEET, BUT BRUTAL","THIS BOOK WAS A CLASSIC, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE A REALLY LONG BOOK TO MAKE A GOOD BOOK THAT STICKS AROUND. THE BOOK IS RIVETING AND SHOWS CHARACTER AND PLOT, ABOUT A MAN WHO IS POOR AND HAS COMMITTED A CRIME BUT THERE IS A QUESTION ON WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD BE HELD RESPNSIBLE BECAUSE HE IS A HALF-WIT AND ALSO HAS BEEN POOR AND MISTREATED DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION"
2516,2,What's the Point?,"I honestly thought that this book by Steinbeck is pointless. It is so short, it really has not plot at all! Yes, it does show the value of friendship, and offers plenty of bookgroup discussion, but I was not thrilled. It really was much too short to go anywhere."
2517,4,"Of mice and men, by John Steinbeck","Of mice and men is written by the nobel prize winner John Steinbeck. It's basicliy about two guys George and Lennie.We neet them in California together on their way to a new job at a ranch. George is the small one and the quick whitted of them, he has promised Lennies aunt to look after him. Lennie is the a big guy, strong as a bull but he is mentally retartded, he's like a kid's head in an adult body. Together they have a dream to own a place where they can live fatta the lan as said in the book and they will have rabbits. Lennie likes animals, espesially small one like rabbits. But he has a strengt he cannot handle, so he ends of killing them.George and Lennie gets a job at the ranch where they meet Slim, Curley, his wife and some ohters. Slim is the ""group leader"" he lokks after everone, Curley is the bosses son, his wife likes boys a lot, Thats what kills George and Lennies dream in the end."
2518,1,Winning the Affiliate Game,It's not even a book. It's a photo copied ringed binder. I was surprised that Amazon marketed this as a ligitimate book published by a real publisher. It is an absolute joke.
2519,3,Mayfair toilet seat hinges defective,Purchased this seat 6 months ago. Love the look and the wood. Put the seat up today and one of the (metal)hinges broke in half. Very surprised at flimsiness of this supposedly quality product. Still want to keep the seat but am having no luck finding new hardware. How can I contact Mayfair products company? Am hopeful they will send me new hardware.
2520,1,JUST SAY NO!!!!!,"This movie is atrocious!! It took away several (or at least FELT like several) hours of my life that I will never ever get back. I really am a Morrissey fan, but this movie makes a mockery of all things Moz - and not in a good way.Don't waste your time with this one. Honestly, the only individuals who might moderately enjoy this film are family members & close friends of those involved in the making of it. The writing is bad & the ""acting"" is even worse. Don't waste your time. I can't say it enough! It's an embarrassment and just AWFUL in every sense of the word. Don't waste your time - SERIOUSLY! I took one for the team on this one. Save yourself!!!"
2521,3,Rent Before You Buy!,"This movie is very low budget and mildly funny throughout. There are a few extra-funny moments. There are NO Smiths or Morrissey songs in this movie and, of course, Morrissey is not in this movie.If you want to buy this movie because you are a big Morrissey fan you should reconsider."
2522,2,Think twice,"I read the reviews before ordering the movie and chose to disregard all the negative feedback and order it anyways. I made a mistake. It isn't the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's pretty close. I wouldn't be as upset about it being bad if I hadn't spent money on it. I am a huge Morrissey fan, and this movie did let me laugh at myself a bit, which was nice. But overall she could have been obsessed with any other star, the movie didn't actually have much to do with Morrissey. If you know someone who owns this movie or can rent it, please do that instead. I don't regret seeing it, but I do regret spending money on it."
2523,1,Rent it before you buy it!,"I'm a big fan of off the wall movies. When I read the reviews I thought this would be a great movie. I really didn't pay attention to the negative ones. The description was interesting and the cover art made it look like this girl was over the top, and would be fun to watch her. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was 30 minutes into the movie before I even laughed, and that was the only laugh of the movie. I was hoping it would just end, it was so STUPID! I waisted my money big time! I've never reviewed any of my past purchases, but after watching this I had to warn people. My only recommendation is try to watch it first before you buy it. I guarantee you won't"
2524,1,Just Plain Bad,"Production quality aside (I allow a little leeway for independent films) this movie was possibly the worst movie I have even seen in my life. After reading other bad reviews I was ready to dismiss them and attempt to enjoy My Life with Morrisey. I am a Smiths fan, but did not care if Morissey was in it or not as long as there was a good storyline to follow. Boy was I wrong. The only thing worse than the script was the acting. That was 125 minutes of my life that I will never have back. Save yourself the time and headache and get a different movie."
2525,4,Handy comp covering the whole of Lydon's career,"Spanning three decades and featuring singles from the Sex Pistols, Public Image Limited, Lydon's post-PiL solo career and a couple of collaborations with other artists, ""The Best of British One Pound Notes"" is a must for any John Lydon fan--particularly if you want to hear the highlights of PiL's spotty later albums. (Yes, this collection is very PiL-intensive, but that's only natural since the group was around from 1978 to 1992, and since they had so many first-rate songs.) Very nice single-disc career retrospective! My only complaint has to do with the edits necessary to fit all this music onto one CD. The ""fools and horses"" verse has been cut from the conclusion of 'Disappointed', one of my all-time favorite PiL songs, and I'm...well, disappointed :( Otherwise, ""Best of British One Pound Notes"" is a pleasure to hear from start to finish."
2526,1,Waste of money,"These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment."
2527,2,Not a Practical Book,"To be honest, I was quite unimpressed with this book. It was a bit interesting, but other than a chapter on being up/down the exchange, it was all things that I may never use in a real game. As well, it didn't provide as many examples of each type of Material unbalance as I'd like, and, though I like Andrew Soltis as an author, his writing wasn't his best here."
2528,5,Perfect for the Corporate Crook in Your Life,My brother is a CEO and this is what I gave him for his birthday! He totally loved it. It is a truly hilarious book.
2529,1,Not funny,I laughed a lot at the description of this book but not even once when reading the real book! All the funny parts were on the cover of the book - nothing left inside.
2530,3,Taffy was ok...,"I would rate this book 1 star if the whole book was like the beginning, and five stars if the whole book was like the end, and the average of 5&1 is 3 so this book is definitely a 3. I liked the saboteur, kidnapping, and rescuing parts the best, and hated the unimportant parts in the beginning."
2531,1,ugh,Hated this movie instantly. It had too much crude humor to be enjoyable. The only good part was the end.
2532,2,The First Fifty Sandler Movies...,"... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream...."
2533,3,Very Good,"Very good movie to watch, if nothing else is on. I would advise not to buy this, only if you don't have anything else to do"
2534,2,Rent Groundhog Day instead. . .,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it just left me just a little disappointed. Sure, it was a pleasant and cheap way to spend an evening, but it just did not draw me in. Perhaps the humor was just a little to adolescent, and the character development a little to predictable- the potty humor of the Drew Barrymore characters brother was unnecessary and the silly characterization of support characters (i.e., the German lady) was a distractionThe premise, though unlikely, could have been workable; but as I watched it, I could not help but think how much better Groundhog Day covered the same material. So, if you are thinking about a comic romance, skip Fifty First Dates and rent Groundhog day."
2535,4,Quality comedy with heart,"Adam Sandler's previous track record has been shaky, with some underwritten comedies (Anger Management) and movies that failed to find a mainstream audience (Big Daddy). 50 firsts Dates makes an improvement by not only providing an original script that lends itself to both comedic double entrees and depth, courtesy of Drew Barrymore's stunning performance, with convincing pathos. Sandler brings another great character to the screen, especially since this story provokes just as many tears as guffaws. This is possibly Sandler's best film and boasts great comedic turns from Rob Scheider and Sean Astin. This film really does work on all levels, and considering I'm not a fan of the genre. Combining an impressive supporting cast with a sprightly running time and hip soundtrack, and you have one of the best comedies of recent years. Highly reccomended."
2536,5,50 first Dates Blu-ray,I was going to purchase this movie on standard DVD until I bought my PS3. I've seen the movie previously on DVD but after watching it on Blu-ray I am glad I waited to purchase it. The picture quality is so much better than DVD and the sound is so clear. I have fallen in love with Blu-ray since I bought this movie and I plan to buy Blu-ray from now on.
2537,2,Not what I expected.,"I just saw this for the first time today and I must admit, I'm disappointed. I didn't get many laughs from it, I heard it was really funny. To me, this is a recycled version of The Wedding Singer, but it's much, much worse. The Wedding Singer was actually good. Nothing new here."
2538,5,Yusef Komunyaakaa meet your spiritual twin...,"she is angela jackson from woodside california, by way of chicago, by way of woodville mississipi, born from the goddess...her poems speak blues, religion, jazz, down-home cooking, long lasting sugar kisses and journeys by astral travelling. she is a spider walking across the face of history a spook opening her heart to reveal her family secrets...this book is poignant, powerful, sexy, and shows the capabilities of lamguage when placed with someone who has respect for it....very few poetry books have moved me...this one does...."
2539,3,its alright!,"came in the mail today, sprayed it on and its just o.k. came fast and packaging was good, i would use this vendor again!"
2540,5,Deal with the Devil!,Great horror/fantasy movie with Claude Rains and Paul Muni.It's scary and it's funny and it's just a gem. Claude Rainsis awesome as the devil who makes a deal with a bad man whocan come back from the dead. The ending is great as the badman has a change of heart. I love this movie. They don'tand can't make movies like this anymore. I bought a $1 dvdat some place a while back and watch it often. you will too!
2541,3,Should have believed the earlier poor reviews,"I chose this item simply because I felt it would be an upgrade on the expandable basket I normally used in my larger pots to steam a multitude of vegetables such as potatos, ear corn, carrots, many onions,brocoli and sometimes more. The prior Item I owned never left me wanting for additional space to contain the items.This set is visually pleasing to look at, but so small that it came in a box almost half the size of a shoe box. That being said, the internal basket is less than half the allowable space inside the main pot. I'd be lucky to steam more than two or three ears of corn at one time. I'm now dealing with a device that never would have been purchased had it been available for me to look at in a store.In summation, don't expect a sizable item, you will be greatly disappointed."
2542,4,so did you read the DNA report?,"it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place, shiva and shakti seals and so on, she then again go back to the imaginary of how European white Aryan descended to the black Dravidian world of Indus valley. if that is how Westerner try to write history of other cultures, I myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people. The bottom line is this: do not try to defend something that is indefensible. please start writing all the facts in details, and tell us cleary: what happened to the Indus valley culture? did it disappear or continued as the Vedic culture?"
2543,3,A small contribution to the growing lit. on TBLT,"There are better books - Willis, Skehan, Ellis, Edwards and Willis. I read the original of this book, and the new updated version is definitely better. Nunan a lot of the time when he thinks he's talking about TBL is in fact really talking about PPP. I have read almost everything on TBLT and Nunan in my view is a very minor figure rather than one of the important researchers/writers in this area of methodology. I bet in the future his next article or book won't be on this subject. So based on all the above I give it 3 and say there are better books out there."
2544,2,Book ends at climax=horrible!:<,"I am writing this review based on the words of my 4th grade son. He was really excited to get this book as he thought that it was going to be a great story. His grandparents live in TX and he thought that it would be a lot of fun to read a book that takes place where they live.He breezed through the book and then was SOOOO disappointed at the ending. He said that just as the book was getting more exciting, it just ended. He was really wishing that the author could have solved the mystery of the boy ghost.Hope that our next book is a better one. He said that he would NOT recommend this book to a friend."
2545,1,You GOTTA be kidding!!!,"Okay, I brought this home, looked it over, and IMMEDIATELY took it back. This is supposed to be for a KID, right? I DON'T THINK SO, at least not mine. I purchased it for my 8 yr. old...my 15 yr. old called it ""skanky"" (which I thought was kind). I can't see how any reasonable parent would want this for a child. Skirt is slutty, comes w/ see-thru thong, and is definately inappropriate, even as a gag gift, unless you're shopping for a pedophile."
2546,2,WOW!,"Guessthey weren't kidding when they said ""BIG"" babys!Well,yeah I agree that these dolls don't really sent a good message for kids.But regular barbie dolls are now old and some how...childish.Most of the barbies are pretty much same old ""Princess"" stuff.ANd since sales haven't been doing too well,Mattel has been rushing and making dumb movies.Anyway The doll is really big.It's lips (lIke every other bratz doll)are huge.THe legs of this doll and big and fat.The skirt too short.She seems to have big hips,I rather have the small bratz dolls."
2547,4,'Harmoniom' could be great or flop...,"For Vanessa Carlton fans, this album is a delight. It is musically much stronger than 'Be Not Nobody', and it really showcases Vanessa's playing ability in certain songs. I feel that this album will probably not be as successful as her first release, simply because it is not as marketable from a radio standpoint. It doesn't have as many strong singles as 'Be Not Nobody' because there is more piano and less background music, making it sound more like easy listening than textured, brooding pop. 'White Houses' is a great song, but not nearly as strong of a single as 'A Thousand Miles'. The only reason for four stars is because you have to have a marketable second album if you want to make a third."
2548,2,Vanessa is getting weird,"There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like ""Half A Week Before Winter,"" which mentions vampires, ""She Floats,"" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and ""The Wreckage,"" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as ""A Thousand Miles."" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."
2549,1,DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL,do not buy this product go somewhere else i got mine today and its horrible i wasted money on a stupid bootleg version go to another site or something the bootleg version in the picture it the one you get im writing this so nobody else wastes there money and time for nothing
2550,1,Bootleg Headband,"This headband sucks!! its not the official one. Its too small for my head. Its supposed to be blue, not black. I'm currently using it as a collar for my dog and thats the only cool thing about it. I'm trying to find a real one in time for this costume party im going to. Plz help!"
2551,5,awesome,"I'm what you call a narutard, this version of sasukes anti leaf headband is awesome. I sort of expected to receive a cruddy metal with cloth flimsily attatched, but it was bolted to the cloth, the cloth was durable and tough, the metal was the real steel, and it bent wherever I wanted it to... definately buy from this seller"
2552,5,perfect,fits great looks great had no problems with it at all i would recommend anyone buying this for crossplay its ligit
2553,3,"Dated, but okay","I learned some adequate skills by watching the guys in ""short shorts"" with ""Eye of the Tiger"" music. After all, the art of attacking and defending doesn't change so much that you need modern music or kits. The breakdown of what's happening in each late 80s game really does explain how the player is responding in a game situation. However, the aforementioned attire/soundtrack makes it hard to shake the feeling that I'm learning an outdated style."
2554,5,Cant stop playing!,"what can i say this album rocks...i mean it may not be American Idol but it is Clay!...who could hate this album...especially with songs like ""The Way"" and ""Touch""...I really wonder who would hate that this album."
2555,5,Great Debut,"Clay is off to a great start. His voice really comes through and the album is well produced. Lots of catchy songs from a vocalist who can really belt them out. His future should be very bright. A few too many love songs, but that's a minor complaint because each song has it's own personality and they're not as mellow as I thought they would be. My favorite tunes are Invisible, I Will Carry You, No More Sad Songs, Perfect Day and Touch. As you can see, that's about half the CD. Well done Clay."
2556,3,Clay needs a new Producer and Song Writer,"What a dissapointment. The songs were over-produced. You can barely hear Clay sing. In an effort to make his style more ""pop"" they have lost the characteristics that made Clay so great. Honestly, I wouldn't have even known it was him singing. Plus, all the songs sound the same. He really needs a new writer. I heard Invisible live and it was great. On the cd it is ok. I thought ""Invisible, The Way, No More Sad Songs, This is the Night and Perfect Day"" had potential. Lets here Clay sing something more upbeat like ""Build me up Buttercup"". Too much like Christain Rock for me! Hoping for something better next time. Clay is worth so much more than this!"
2557,5,Could Not Ask For More,"Don't know what ""Dork Rock"" is coming from, a lot of the comments weren't even about the CD! I think this is a fantastic CD as do a lot of my peers, young and old. It really is a CD for everyone. Clay's voice is wonderful, he has a lot of range and there isn't a bad song on his CD. Usually, when I buy a CD, I have one or maybe, two tracks that I really like, but this CD doesn't have just one or two, they are all great!!! Definitely worth buying and listening to!"
2558,1,I love the way I wisper your name when I'm asleep,"Does this guy tape record himself at night? For more grade school poetry, nonsensical statements, and Haiku's written by dumb people go out and get this CD ASAP."
2559,4,Give us back the real voice of Clay Aiken,"I am a huge fan of Clay Aiken and his beautiful natural voice.After listening to Clay's new Cd I was disappointed.Not in Clay but what the mixers and engineers did to his voice.I wasn't sure it was Clay. I love the songs that were chosen for Clay to sing like Touch,Shine,The Way and I Will Carry You.All The songs on the Cd had very powerful words and great music.But lacked Clay's powerful voice.Maybe Clay's next Cd will be in his orginal voice."
2560,1,Why won't amazon post my review,"I wonder why Amazon will not post my review of this album. I loved clay on american idol - but he lost get over it. This album is average at best. Stop pushing him as though he won. Reuben is the winner and Clay's ""Measure of a Man"" does not measure up to Reuben's ""Soulful""."
2561,2,Yawn.....,"Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough, but his music is just so corny and boring. All ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs. I can't even bear to listen. I only do it to figure out what all the furor is about. I still haven't. Save yourself the effort."
2562,1,schmalz,"In the new edition of webster's they should stick a photo of this to define ""schmalz"". Oh my god, is this what our music culture has devolved to?. This album was inflicted on me as I was in Border's the other day. I left without buying anything, which is unusual for me. By the way, cats are wonderful creatures."
2563,5,clay proves his greatness again,wow. just wow. clay has proven his greatness once again. his voice is just so powerful you just fall in love. you can play this cd for hours and it never tires. i love it. no words can express how wonderful it is.
2564,5,magnifiscent !! a must have in any CD collection,"For anyone who appreciates good music these days this CD is a must have. It is easy to listen to , timeless, classic and Clay Aikens voice is truly something special after a long time.it is not overproduced , and all the songs included are catchy and listenable. My favourites are measure of a man , the way, i survived you, . i have listened to this CD over and over again and still not sick of it.it is finally a CD where i love all the songs included and dont haveto skip any.Clay keeps the fans of pop,country,rock, ballad happy. it was no coincidence he won the Fans choice american music award.For anyone who has not had the pleasure of hearing this amazing voice, this collection is a must."
2565,1,AMAZING!!,"It's AMAZING how horrible this CD is. The truth needs to be told, and the other reviews for this CD up to this point are very misleading. Clay has talent for sure. It takes talent to dupe all of America into thinking you have a wonderful voice. Clay, I love you, you're my homey, but for God's sake.. stop making music. Or at least release it independently so we don't have to see and hear this CD everywhere we go. The first two tracks are disappointing. Three and four are boring, and the rest are just plain gut-wrenchingly awful. I'm sorry for all you Clay fans out there that will have problems with what I'm saying but please be honest with yourselves and boycott Aiken."
2566,3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,ALTHOUGH I AM AFAN OF CLAYS I DID NOT THINK THAT THE ALBUM WAS ANYTHING SPECIAL. THE BACKGROUND MUSIC SEEMED OUT OF SYNC WITH HIS VOICE
2567,3,Achin' for the real Clay,"Frustration sums up my feelings about Clay Aiken's cd debut. Many of the qualities that made all of us jump on the ""Clay Bandwagon"" during American Idol are missing here. The music is polished and clean, too clean. Gone are the vulnerable moments and the ""surprise"" elements of his songs. The lyrics are insipid. This is elevator music, ""Musak"". I wish that Neil Sedaka had produced this album. Then we would have all enjoyed Clay's version of ""Solitaire"", done only as Clay can do. I do not fault Clay with this. The blame rest solely on the songwriters and producers of this Cd. Let's hope Clay's ""sophomore"" effort allows him to be himself, the Clay that earned him all our votes."
2568,5,BEST MUSIC CD IN YEARS,THIS IS DEFINITELY THE BEST CD I'VE BOUGHT IN YEARS!!! EVERY SONG IS BURSTING WITH CLAY'S ENERGY AND SPECTACULAR VOICE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM SING THEM IN PERSON! HE WAS DEFINITELY THE BEST ON AMERICAN IDOL 2. THE STRENGTH OF HIS VOICE WILL CARRY HIM A LONG WAY. EVERY SONG TOUCHED ME!
2569,3,Disappointing,"Clay was so much better on Amercinal Idol. This CD is good, but not even close to what I was expecting given how he performed on TV. Hopefully, this album was a compromise with record execs and he'll be able to really impress us on his next album."
2570,1,what.................. he wont be big,ok clay has a good vocie but come on hes ugly in the songs are the same'ol pop songs just think of him as another ruben good vocie but to ugly but one thing ruben can sing better in is a real singer with good song but clay sucks big time he wont be big so trust me on this one i know music in i know when i say this cd ant worth it dont buy it ant worth the money theres not even one good song on this cd this whole cd sucks so DONT BUY IT
2571,1,Very bland,"I am a big fan of pop music among other genres but this album lacks a personality. Sort of like being stuck in a time warp and transported back to the late 90s. The songs just seem to blend together. It also appears as if Mr. Aiken is not too invested in his on product, he seems very detached from the songs.I also found the album overproduced. It lacks oomph and edge, in other words, I found it boring."
2572,1,california,"I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail."
2573,2,Disappointing,"The majority of the songs on this album are very poorly written; borderline cheesy.Although Clay's voice has improved even further since winning runner up on American Idol, these songs do not do his voice justice.""Invisible"" is the strongest song on the album and is very catchy, but the album just nose dives after the 1st song.Being a huge fan of American Idol, I am extremely disappointed in Clay's debut album. His sales may end up being higher than Kelly Clarkson's or Justin Guarini's, but out of the 3, I'd have to say that Kelly is still American Idol's golden child.I'll pass Clay's cd onto someone else and keep Kelly's in my cd player. Too bad that Clay didn't receive the same quality of songs as Kelly did. Now I can only cross my fingers and hope that Ruben & Tamyra will not have an album full of poorly written songs like Clay and Justin have."
2574,5,Measure of a Man - I Love Every Single Track!,"It's hard to believe that a debut album could be this terrific! This is the first time I've listened to a CD and have no desire to skip a single track. I love every one of them and each day I have a new favorite. At first my favorite was 'No More Sad Song' (his voice just sounds so rich on that song) then it was 'Perfect Day' (another wonderful showcase for his beautiful voice) then it was 'Touch' (one of the most poetic and sensual songs I've ever heard; if you use your imagination while you listen to that song, you will drive yourself crazy) and today my favorite is 'The Way' (I think this could become a Number 1 song for weeks, maybe months!). The title track is really growing on me, too. Clay Aiken is, simply, PERFECTION! (My apologies to Neil Sedaka for stealing his description of Clay Aiken.)"
2575,4,Fabulous Voice,"Love this album. Didn't give it a full 5 stars only because the songs are a little weak - However, they grow on you and Clay's voice is wonderful. So nice to hear an artist who does not need technology to make him sound better. Must say, I like all of the songs, which is unusual for any album no matter how good the artist. Have not stopped playing the album and can't wait to see him get some really good material to show what he can do. My favorite is The Way."
2576,5,5+++++++ Stars!,"Wow, I am extremely impressed!!! Clay Aiken's voice is just amazing. I adore the songs ""Invisible"" and ""No More Sad Songs"". I want Clay to put out a Christmas CD and a Christian CD next. I am buying a ton of these for gifts - go Clay!!!"
2577,5,"13-Year old that's ""Aiken for Clay""","Clay Aiken's Measure of a Man is extraordinary. It has a little bit of everything in it. When I first heard Invisible, it sounded a bit stalkeresque to me. But the music & lyrics really makes you want to sing along. 'When You Say You Love Me' sounds country to me, as well as other songs. A lot of his songs are about getting over someone, so I get them mixed up often. The beat of 'No More Sad Songs' is really good, it sounds pretty different from the rest of the album. I already got tired of 'This is the Night', although it brought back a lot of American Idol memories. 'Measure of a Man' is extremely well-written, and I love to sing along to it! 'Touch' is the flip-side of the album. It's a bit seductive, but the music is amazing. Overall, it's a really good CD if you like Clay Aiken."
2578,3,"All right, but...","This CD was ok - Clay has a great voice, but the album sounded overproduced and all of the songs sounded very similar to me. I didn't think it showed off his range and the magnitude of his voice very well. Probably the biggest problem, though, is that I bought this and Josh Groban's Closer CD at the same time. Poor Clay can't compete with Josh for time in my CD player..."
2579,2,Not as good as it could have been,"In watching Clay on TV, I was in hopes of great things from him in his first CD. It was VERY vanilla! Nothing spectacular...or stretching. I think he played it safe and I was hoping it sounded a bit better. I won't purchase it. I borrowed the CD from a friend and decided not to buy it. I think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this CD."
2580,1,"Great Singer, Wrong Material","The Clive Davis churned out anothere same ol', same ol'...like what David Foster did to Josh Groban....great voices with little to do. The singer can be great but if the material is mostly wrong...oh, well....I will hope for better next time!"
2581,4,What is the deal with No More Sad Songs?,"Okay, I only searched through 100 reviews to see if anyone mentioned No More Sad Songs, and very few did. So, let me say that it is by far the best song on the album and frankly, worth the price of the entire album. Of course, I like the other songs, too, but I'm shocked more people haven't said glowing things about No More Sad Songs. Then again, I don't typically like the pop music of the last 2 decades -- I probably can't name one song on the Top 40. So, my tastes are probably unusual.I was hoping Clay would do some covers like during AI. His versions of To Love Someboday, Sugar Pie Honey Bunch, and Here There and Everywhere were absolutely amazing. Clay's AI performances were the only performances by anyone that have ever reminded me of Elvis (though he doesn't dance much like him : )."
2582,2,A disapointed debut album,"I've anticipated this cd for some time and must say it is not what I had expected it to be. I thought it would contain more ballads, lite pop and broadway songs, which he performed on American Idol. This cd is very boring, everything sounds alike. Clay has great range but the music Clive Davis selected for his first cd does not show the versatility shown on American Idol. I still believe Clay is Broadway, not this run of the mill type music."
2583,2,Disappointing debut from a very talented young man,"I agree with the other reviews that Clay Aiken has one of the most beautiful voices in music today. But I am disappointed in his new album. He has been interviewed many times saying ""I sing from my heart about things that move me,"" yet, it seems as if every song sounds the same. I blame this on poor writing on and not on the vocalist himself. I am a HUGE Clay supporter and rooted for him throughout the entire American Idol competition, but I must say, this album does nothing for me. After hearing ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" I was expecting to be really WOWED by his debut album... I am bummed out this one didn't stack up to his single. I am surprised there are so many people impressed by this CD... I can't help but wonder what song I'm listening to when every track sounds like the same ol' same ol' to me."
2584,3,"#2 in American Idol, #1 CD for sure!","This Cd has a wonderful range of beautiful songs from Clay Aiken. His voice is magnetic! You can listen for hours and hours and never get tired of his beautiful voice and sweet music!Hey, there's got to be something to it if my mom loves it as much as I do!"
2585,5,Wonderful CD.,"I have waited patiently for this first CD from Clay Aiken and now that I have it - I am extremely pleased. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. My favourite songs change daily but at the moment they are - I Survived You; No More Sad Songs; Invisible and I Will Carry You.Well done Clay."
2586,5,Amazing,I usually have one or two songs that I skip on each cd. I love all of the songs on this cd. What else can I say? His voice is so pure. I reccommend this cd to people of all ages.
2587,5,OUTSTANDING,"The CD shows Clay's range. I especially liked Run to Me, I Survived You, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man, well, the whole thing. His lower register is so smooth. He has a great voice and has proven it time and time again. I would like to see him come out with a Christmas CD."
2588,1,cd up for trash,tried to listen to it again to give it a chance. still it sounded as disgusting as the first try.my only advice to Clay now is to make sure he completes his college degree soonest cos he may be back sooner teaching than he expects.i also wish him all the luck in his future endeavors.i know he has already lost several fans who can tell good music from bad.
2589,2,clay still second best,"clay aiken is not only a very bad role model and icon, but i don't think he can reach to the stasis of ruben studdard. this album had only 1 song that i liked, invincible. clay aiken could be more upbeat."
2590,5,Excellant,I was very surprised at how good an album this is. This album is full of great pop songs. Billboard was right when it said this was the best pop album of 2003. I guess my favorite songs are Perfect Day and Invisible. They are all very good songs with very good melodies.
2591,5,They said he couldn't do pop...,"... well he did... and it works! I didn't see much of either AI, but when I heard this guy's voice! WOW! I took notice and was anxious to hear the CD. I was surprised at the total pop/contemporary sound and impressed at how well he carried it off. While I could listen to his huge voice singing Bridge Over Troubled Waters all day long, I'm glad his album wasn't full of a bunch of old remakes, mainly because in this album he proved he could do more. Had the songs been from AI, he would have then been accused of karaoke and over-singing. This album is full of new songs (new to most of the population anyway) that get better each time you hear them and that after a few listens, you can't stop singing them. The future of Clay Aiken will be an exciting and different one to watch!"
2592,1,SO Disappointing,"A great voice impeded by dreadful songs, most written by a committee (it seems) and humdrum orchestration. Clay, please listen to GREAT songs by the master songwriters -- Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, so many others. You have the voice. Please find the music."
2593,1,"One Extended, Boring Song",Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap.
2594,1,Woohooo Bland Ballads,"Clay has a horrible voice (sorry obsessed Claymates,it's true) and this cd proves it. All the songs are generic and unoriginal, he brings nothing new to the music industry. His voice is so irritating and grating. A year from now (or not even) he will be forgotten."
2595,2,What happened?,"Clay knocked my socks off on American Idol, and I will always believe that he should have won. His interpretations of familiar pop tunes and standards were awesome. That's why the CD was disappointing. Comprised of unfamiliar tunes, and without his exciting stage presence, this CD is completely unremarkable. I'm sure it was popular with the teenyboppers (the CD includes a mini-poster), but his fan base is much, much broader. Clay, if you're reading, we'd like to hear more of your unique interpretations of familiar music. Pick a decade, pick an era, pick a genre. You have the potential to be a icon and not just an idol, but it won't happen with stuff like this,"
2596,5,Awesome. Simply Awesome.,Clay should have won American Idol. Everyone knows that. This cd will kill the sales of Ruben's cd. I hope this cd is still in the top 5 when Ruben's cd comes out. Go Clay. You are a true American Idol.
2597,5,Year of the Clay,"We found a new idol and he just turns out to be one of the coolest and smartest guy around. An amazing voice, such charisma and feeling in his tone....He's the best. Love you Clay."
2598,5,I love Clay!!,This CD was an absolute joy and I'm so very glad I bought it. I never watched American Idol and somehow I keep thinking he's the winner because I see more of him than the other guy. I love his voice and the songs on this CD are excellent.
2599,5,CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI,THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM.
2600,5,Clay's Wonderful Voice,I love hearing Clay sing anything. This album brings out a remarkable range of emotions. His voice is beautiful in every song. The songs are interesting and Clay's voice captures the listener the moment the songs begin. I hope this is the beginning of many more albums for Clay. I would like to see him continue to experiment and still stay true to who he is. I highly recommend purchasing this CD.
2601,1,The End of Music,"The entire concept is just bad. I don't care how much this guy whines about his hard life, he's not deserving. He is wasting tons of record label space that could be occupied by true, creative, artists. The whole idea of a country picking the next big pop star from a TV show is just sad. It's a shame children will grow up thinking this is good. Radio is forever gone, hang the DJ.JB"
2602,2,Broadway Clay,"I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying."
2603,5,America's Choice,"Clayton has hit a homerun with his debut CD, Measure of a Man! What an outstanding voice and what a refreshing change in themusic industry. Finally, someone has come along to sing the songs that we can listen to with our children, and not be ashamed at what they might hear. Finally, an artist who is not afraid to stand up to the record producers and lets them know that he will not record anything that he wouldn't want his own children to hear. Finally, a musical CD that we can sing along with. Thank you, Clayton for an outstanding CD!"
2604,5,Definitely 2003s Biggest New Talent,With 2003 came the angelic voice of a pure raw talent. This southern crooner can definitely move your heart and soul with every word he sings. I have loved music all my life including a little of everything from the 60s clear to now and no one can move me over and over again like Clay Aiken. He has proven that music can span across all boundaries to join fans both young and old alike. If you have not yet bought this album it is a definite must have for any music collection.
2605,5,Greatest Male Vocalist Of All Time,"I highly anticipated this album and and was pleased, but not suprised to find it refreshing and moving. Clay Aiken delivers his songs with emotion and beauty leaving the listener wanting more. This album will not disappoint. I bought 2!"
2606,5,Silver lining in a dark cloud of top 40 music in 2003.,"In my opinion, there really hasn't been a top 40 artist who has stood out this year (besides 3DD with ""Here without You""). I heard AI Clay Aiken's hit single ""Invisible"" and this has been one of the better hit songs of the year. I would recommend this CD if you are for easy listening."
2607,5,Measure of a Man,"I ordered this album 3 months ago (it was just released today, Oct 14 and it is being sent now) but I couldn't wait so I went and bought one today.It was worth waiting for!! Every song in it is CLAY. Of course I have my favorites but I'll let you choose yours.Buy it now. You won't be sorry."
2608,5,This guy measures up!,"I bought this CD for my 12yr old daughter who is a big fan of Clay Aiken, and I have to say that I'm hooked as well! How refreshing it is to hear a performer that isn't a pig..., foul,violent, druggie or has sold out to the recording mecca's! Easily the best new artist I have heard in years,Clay's ""Measure Of A Man"" delivers and you won't be dissapointed. I personally have listened to the CD a dozen times, and ALL the songs are well done.I honestly like all the songs,[many give me chills with that voice] and feel many of the cuts could be big hits. This CD is probably destined for greatness. I will buy this guys stuff from now on, he is an impressive young man on and off the stage, and I'm pround to say he's a good example for young people today..."
2609,4,Measure of a Man,Fabulous CD for first timer Clay Aiken. Incredible voice and music will appeal to all age crowd. Congratulations Clay.....you deserve the best!!!
2610,5,It's All Good,"When was the last time you bought a CD and loved every single song? This is a CD that will definately please anyone who listens to it. Each day my favorite track changes. Easy to listen to, emotional lyrics, and upbeat songs- this CD has it all. I'll be listening to this for a long time."
2611,1,Worst recording to come along,"in a long time.This has got to be a joke. Please don't wasteyour money on this CD. It's not all what somereviewers on here are saying it is. They areobviously Clay's fans trying to convince the worldthat he has a golden voice. The guy can sing, butbelieve me so can a lot of people. He released thisthing too soon and should have selected better songsto sing. Measure of a man just doesn't do it for me.Sorry Clay, this one flopped."
2612,1,Too syrupy,Reminds me of buble gum pop too much. I hate it. It was one ofthe worse cds ever. I am gonna sell it and get my money back.
2613,4,"a music lover from rochester, ny","This CD was great. Every Clay fan should own it. In my opinion, the best songs on the CD are ""Invisible"", ""When You Say You Love Me"" & ""This Is The Night"". However, every song is great. He has a great pop sound that is very ""radio-friendly"" with that great ""pop hook"" and will appeal to most pop lovers. This CD will surely go straight to the top of the charts!"
2614,5,Awesome CD,"Honestly the guy can sing. Out of 12 songs, I would say more than half are excellent, and the others are worth listening too. Most cd's have 2-4 decent songs out of 12-15, however this one tops them all. If you think the cd could be better, I disagree. Everyhting in life could always be better, you cant change that. As a first Clay Aiken Deput album...?? well It Rocks. Worth every penny."
2615,5,A CD that you never need the skip button to enjoy,"Track after glorious track, Mr. Aiken allows us into his soul and spreads joy through our hearts. His voice is truly blessed. Listen to this CD and just try not to sing along and smile."
2616,1,Disappointed - sorry,"I went mad for this guy during the American Idol trials! Sat down and watched and cheered each week; all excited when the album came out and more importantly arrived in Ireland! But when I listened to it; he didn't sound at all like he did in American Idol.I think his song choices on this album left a lot to be desired. Where were all the brilliant songs he sang on the American Idol show? That's what I wanted to hear, that's what I would WANT to hear if I went to see him live in concert.But other than that, I wish him well and hope he takes note of this!"
2617,2,Not What I Expected!!,"I waited in anticipation for the release of this album. I think it's awful with the exception of two tracks - ""Measure of A Man"" and ""This is the Night"". The background music is far too loud and drowns out Clay most of the time. It sounds like he is shouting to be heard above the music. The wonderful voice we heard on ""American Idol"" is certainly not evident on this CD. The lack of ballads is disappointing - he's certainly not cut out to be the next rock star - please don't try to portray him as such."
2618,4,It TOUCHED me!,"I'm not a fan of pop music particularly but I bought the CD because of Aiken's voice and personality. The highest compliment I can pay is that after repeated listenings, I still enjoy it. My biggest complaint is that I think the CD's over-produced (I like the live bootleg version of ""Invisible"" better than the CD, e.g.) But, overall, it's catchy and fun and I find myself humming a lot of the tunes through the day. I don't understand why it's not getting more radio play. My favorite track is ""Touch."" Clay sounds like a G-version George Michael. Ooh baby!"
2619,1,Ridiculous effort,Clay Aiken needs to take a seat. His 15 minutes of fame has ended and it's a wrap for him. He should stick to doing broadway tunes and not Pop. His album is a sad attempt and i really wouldn't recommend it to anyone... not even my worst enemy.
2620,1,SUCKED,"Pointless CD unless u like badly sung ballads that have no meaning worst thing everdo not be persuaded by these ""claymate"" people they are biased and know that clay does infact stink they just can't except it if u know wats good for u STAY AWAY FROM ""MEASURE OF A MAN"""
2621,5,Great First CD,"Clay's voice is amazing, as usual. The CD contains ""radio-friendly"" songs, as well as ballads that AI fans will expect (a tough balance to achieve). It is nearly impossible to please everyone, without alienating someone, but this CD comes about as close as any I have ever heard. It is a great CD and I would recommend it to anyone. I look forward to many more Clay Aiken CDs in the future."
2622,1,wow what a bomb,i am sorry to say that this album really changed my opinion of clay aiken. This album is horrible and if you want to know why there are so many used copys available to buy you'll know after listening to this. I want Ruben Studdard
2623,4,Clay's voice shines through,"Reading the reviews it seems that many are based on the like or dislike of Clay or the continuation of a Ruben/Clay competition. Get over it! Ruben won the AI contest, they are both talented singers and their styles are different. That said, my critique of the album is that the songs are a little weak, overly orchestrated in some cases and some hokey instrumentals in other cases. Clay's voice, however, shines through and overcomes the weak material and the little time that was taken to put the album together. If you are sentimental and romantic at heart, like ballads, like to sing along, love Clays voice ... or any of the above, you will like this album. It just makes you feel good. Despite its shortcomings, I couldn't give it less than 4 stars since I love it and listen to it at least once a day. My favorite is The Way co written by Enrique Iglesias and hopefully we'll see some more like this on the next album ... stronger songs to match the depth of Clay's voice."
2624,5,clay is a true measure of a man,"Clay's first CD is actually very good. It is not the raw voice that all of us Clay fans expected from the american idol performances but, it is of a more experienced Clay. His voice range is incredible and the music is soft and beautiful. It is not surprising that this CD has gone double platinum in one week. The fans really appreciate his talent. This young man is going to be around for a long time. This CD is the blossoming of a living legend."
2625,5,I'M IN LOVE WITH CLAY'S VOICE!!!,"I think this CD is Fantastic! To the person from Charlotte, who said there was no emotion in the songs, what CD were you listening to? Certainly not Measure of A Man!! I feel the emotion in every song and DO feel like he is singing to me. It's been a long time since I have listened to a CD that touched my heart and soul as much as this one. I am sooooo in love with his voice!!!"
2626,5,The Only American Idol worth listening to,"This album will not disappoint. I am not a big fan of Clay Aiken but I ended up enjoying the album; you will never hear more beautiful songs as softly sung by him. He sings in a voice that is smooth, mature- and he can really soar when he wants. This is a great ""feel good""album!"
2627,3,Sweet but subdued,"I listened to the entire CD today and kept waiting for that big voice to come belting out, the way it did on Clay's performances of ""Bridge"" or ""Somewhere Out There"" on the show. All of the tracks on this debut were well done, definitely a pop record. The collection didn't blow me away like Kelly's did last year, but I liked the title track as well as ""Invisible"" (which he sang in the concert). If Clay ever makes it to Broadway and is able to use his voice to its full volume and emotion, I think he will blow the audiences away."
2628,3,upsetting,"I was very surprised about the poor quality for the CD. Clay's voice is awesome but many of the songs lack some...umph. The songs Invisible and Measure Of A Man have grown on me but I believe that the lyrics and music on most of the CD is poor quality. I am hoping that Neil Sedekah will write a CD for Clay really soon, to show off the AMAZING voice that Clay has."
2629,5,Addictive,"I can't get enough of this CD. I am a BIG Clay Aiken fan, so I was prepared to like it. But, even with my favorite performers there are always songs I love and songs I skip over. Well, on this CD I don't skip over any songs! They are all incredible. He makes you feel like he is singing directly to you! His voice is masterful and knowing a bit about the person behind the music makes one like him even more! I had to buy two to have one in my car and one in my purse (in my portable cd player)! I can't wait until the next one!"
2630,4,Clay's voice is amazing.,"When I first listened to Clay's album it didn't really grab me, but it was in my cd player and I kept listening to it and it got better and better each time. His voice is absolutly amazing, I could listen to him sing forever. It amazes me at how much talent he has. If you liked him on American Idol you'll definately enjoy this album."
2631,5,Measure of a Man........the best CD ever!,"I highly recommend this CD, Clay's voice is amazing. I'm so glad he is finally getting the recognition he deserves. My favorite song is ""Measure of a Man"" but they are all wonderful. Add this CD to your collection you won't be sorry and you'll forever be a fan!"
2632,3,Overproduced,"Yes, Clay is an awesome singer, but coming from a show where the contestants sung songs that actually showcased their voices, I was disappointed in this album. Why does everything have to sound popish? The music drowns out Clay's voice on the majority of the cd. And the little ""rawness"" that Clay had on the show has been toned down and smoothed out. I think those qualities were part of why I love his singing so much. The cd is nice, but I hope he can last long enough to release another cd, one where more of his vocal talent can actually be heard and appreciated."
2633,3,disappointed,"I love Clay's voice, but on the CD I was looking forward to the style he portrayed on the show. I was very disappointed that it was all pop music, when his voice comes through the best with ballads and soulful songs like he did on the show. Yes, his voice sounds good still, but the CD is nothing special as it sounds like any other male pop singer. You can't hear the bits of his accent as he sings. The whole CD through i was just hoping for more of his old style."
2634,5,VERY PLEASED!!!,"I am surprised by what bad reviews Clay has received here. I purchased the CD today and have played it twice now. I am quite satisfied.You know it's a great song if on the first play you find yourself wanting to play it over again. Although I can't say all of these tracks made me feel this way, a few did. These were, ""Invisible,"" I Will Carry You,"" ""When You Say You Love Me,"" ""I Survived You"" and of course ""This Is The Night.""I enjoyed all tracks. It's hard to find a CD that you can actually say that about! Though I have one complaint.. the track titled ""No More Sad Song!"" I don't know maybe it's not such a bad song, and even though I don't have a problem with Elton John, just being reminded of Elton's song ""Sad Songs"" made me want to scream! God I hate that song!!! (Sorry fans of that song.)I know it's not the same song that clay is singing... I just don't like the title!Overall, 12 tracks and only just the one I couldn't stand to hear, just based on Elton Johns song..."
2635,3,A solid debut,"This album is a good way to start a recording career, but it's not the best pop album of the year. It's not full of hits, maybe a couple. The best chance is with ""The Way"". There are a couple of low points too as with ""I Survived You"" The lyrics in that one are on the silly side with words like ""You wrote me off like I was doomed"". His voice carries the album well even with some subpar songwriting. I don't know where people are getting double platinum from. The album sold a little over 600,000 copies in it's first week to debut at number one. It will be platinum soon."
2636,2,Barry Manilow meets Neal Diamond,"This is a huge diappointment. The producers of this CD should be publicly flogged. Clay's fans love his strong, booming voice and ability to pound out ballads. You'll hear NONE of that on this CD. I am amazed that producers with decades of experience wouldn't understand that fans want to hear the full range of Clay's voice. Instead, what you will hear are a bunch of sappy, run of the mill pop tunes that will uninspire. Save your money and buy some old Barry Manilow cd's. At least you'll get what you are paying for. Let's hope, on his next CD, that Clay is allowed to sing the way we all know that he can."
2637,2,Doesn't do it.,"I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money."
2638,2,Rather Boring,Living in Australia we are in the middle of our first series of Australian Idol so I was very curious as to what Clay Aiken actually sounded like so brought this CD. I found the majority of the CD rather boring. I do already own both Kelly and Justins CD's both of which I find alot more entertaining than Clays.Clay's CD seems very radio friendly and MORish which I spose alot of people would like but I found that maybe I needed the Hype of American Idol II to enjoy him more.
2639,5,Absolutely Fantastic,"This is an amazing work. His album is full of songs that are full of substance, you can relate to them and he sings them very meaningfully. I Will Carry You is a fabulous song.Well done!"
2640,4,Great Debut,"This man's voice is even better than I remember it from the show. Some of the material is a little trite, but Clay's soaring voice and interpretation make it rise above the fray. Clay paints his lyrics for the listener - committing to every word. I really enjoyed the simplicity, albeit, Christian overtones of Measure of a Man, the confidence in Run to Me and for some reason, I can't get I Will Follow You out of my head. If this were the 80's or 90's, he'd easily have 3 or 4 solid singles from this album. Sadly, non-melodic rap music has driven more soothing sounds from the radio. Let's hoping some radio stations are willing to take a chance on Clay....."
2641,5,Simply Awesome,Clay was my favorite male of the second Idol serious from the word go. I have looked forward to this CD forever and I was not let down!!! It is really good!!!
2642,3,Clay Aiken,"Personally I dont know what all the fuss is about, Clay Aiken is average at best, which is why I gave him a 3, all the American Idol singers are average because its something they are trying to learn how to do. Music Artists have to have it in them from the beginning like Mariah, or Whitney or even Justin Timberlake, its something theyve always wanted to do and thats what sets them apart from all the rest, including Clay. I will say one thing good about him for all his fans, ""The Way"" is the best song on the album, and he should have done it more Country and he would be sitting at #1 on the Charts. Record sales mean little actually if they only play your music on elevator radio stations! Can you say Flash in the Pan!!!"
2643,1,Please tell me this is a joke.,You've got to be kidding me. I've got a 12 year old brother that can sing really loud and smile a lot. Can he get a record deal? Straight to the top of the list as WORST RECORD OF THE YEAR.
2644,1,It sucks!,"Clay has an incredible beautiful voice, but the song selections are annoyingly boring! I found myself skipping each sound alike song until I reached the start of the CD...I want my money back. Clay, your CD sucks"
2645,5,HE's So CUTE!!!,"His singing is ok, and the songs are not my style, but the four stars are for his looks, oowww!!!"
2646,5,GREAT CD by CLAY AIKEN!!!!!,"I truly love this entire album, beautifully done! I love all of the songs so much! If I had to choose a favorite it would be THE WAY, my goodness, so darn romantic!!! WOW, then I would say touch, WOW, talk about GREAT MUSIC!!! Thank you Clay for making such a wonderful album my entire family can listen to, and my kids can dance to!"
2647,2,"Clay, buddy what happened?","Yuk! is about all I can say. I loved Clay on the show but this cd sounds like one 50 min track. Save your money and get a copy used if you must. They are here for $4. If you bought This Is The Night/Bridge cd single, then you got the best. These people saying Amazing! 5 stars! must be with the Arista marketing team. They must be getting paid to log on reviews. Clay is great and Clay can sing, but this cd has three good tracks."
2648,5,Clay Aiken - God Given Talent,"This CD is fabulous! I cannot say enough kind things about his music or him as a person. The song choices are perfect for his vocal range. He gives me goose bumps, his voice is so intense. If you like Adult Contemporary music, then you will love this CD. Since I purchased it, October 14, 2003, I have listened to it everyday at work for the entire 8 hour day. Co-workers have asked me what I'm listening to and have purchased it too. I can truly see this CD going Platnum! Go Clay!!"
2649,5,And WHY didn't he win again?,"Clay Aiken's debut album, Measure of A Man, blew me away the first time I listened to it. Along with several beautiful ballads, there are also some upbeat tracks that allow Clay to show his versatility as an artist. Some of my favorite songs were Invisible, the catchy, upbeat first song on the album, and The Way, which showcases Clay's amazing voice. Overall, this is a great album which many people will enjoy!"
2650,5,How can you not like it?,"I just don't understand anybody who didn't like this CD. I love every single song. These sweet power ballads are just awesome!! A voice like Clay's makes me smile. Why he was a runner-up, I have no idea.You have to get this CD, because each of the songs have great hooks, melodies and tempos. I can't just pick one favorite. I encourage everybody to get this CD and dance with your loved one. I read a review where someone said that Clay lost his ""soul"". I could not disagree with you more. It is his soul that makes these songs work and make them powerful.Whoever reads this review, I encourage you to buy this CD and give it a try."
2651,5,Measure of a Man,"I love eveyone of the songs on this CD. The voice of Clay Aiken is refreshing and mezermizing. I'm amazed that in this day and age with the stuff that's out there that an album such as this is even possible. The music and words are beautiful and very reminiscent of music from the 80's. There is actually hope for music today, thanks to Clay Aiken."
2652,2,Clay Aiken... where are you???,"Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stoppingnumbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in aWestend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even ""Solitaire"" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!!"
2653,5,INCREDIBLE VOICE,"Even if the material is not the best, Clay more than makes up for it with his spectacular voice. Buy this cd, then listen to the kind of voice that only comes along once in a while.Happy listening! :)"
2654,4,Sing in the shower,"This album is not too edgy nor is it complete schlock. It doesn't hit you over the head with sex and swearing, but it does not go over the top in the smaltz. There are some songs that manage to be edgy and sexy, mainly because they don't try to be. This is pretty much just a fun cd. You can sing these songs in the shower. Touch is a very smooth song. With it's hip hop/latin rhythms, this song should be a hit. Invisible is pretty catchy. When You Say You Love Me will get you going. It's a country pop song that could really go eitiher way. This is the Night is stuck on here. That is not one of the best. If you really want to hear something sexy, put on Run To Me. He sings in his gorgeous and deep lower register. There are plenty of key changes in this one. Listen to that and The Way and Perfect Day. You'll be impressed with the range. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rockin edge. The songs on this cd could be better. Hopefully, Aiken will further try out hip hop and country."
2655,5,Refreshing,Received Clays CD and have almost worn it out! Just great - great voice - great music - great words!!! So nice to finally have a man who can sing!!! A young man the youth can look up to!I recomend this CD to all ages - you will love it!!
2656,1,Was disappointed,All the songs sounded the same. Sappy twiny ballads. I heard he had a great voice yet heard nothing spectacular in this cd. I could just bought an all love song cd of various artists and gotten better satisfaction. I would not recommend this cd to anyone with musical taste and it will put you to sleep. Go back to the drawing board Clay and try again and maybe with some feeling and variety this time. I should have known it would blow considering how fast he put it out my dumb.
2657,2,Disappointing,"This cd is very disappointing...His voice is not used to the fullest extent at all. He compromises his voice, it's computerized, and his values on this cd."
2658,5,Billboard said it.,"This is on the Billboard site: Clay Aiken's ""Measure of a Man"" is the best pop album of 2003. Every song, every note is brimming with ambition and glory. Thanks to the bull's-eye A&R talents of RCA chief Clive Davis and a cast of grade-A songwriters-including Cathy Dennis, Desmond Child, Kara DioGuardi, Gary Burr, Steve Morales, Andreas Carlsson-the ""American Idol"" hero's debut album perfectly matches his radiantly melodramatic voice with good, old-fashioned power ballads aimed straight for the gods. Throughout, the timeless production focuses squarely on Aiken's immense talent. ""Run to Me"" is arguably the sweet spot, the quintessential tear-jerker, along with show-stoppers ""No More Sad Songs,"" ""I Survived You"" and the title track. In another radio era, this album could be the ""Thriller"" of the day, spawning hit after hit. In any case, fans have plenty to celebrate. ""Measure of a Man"" is an utter triumph of art and commerce.-CT"
2659,4,Clay,"Clay strikes a bigger hype than any of the American Idols and debuts his first album which is just amazing! Clay is a talented, sweet young man with many ambitions for the future.His voice is so strong and will carry you track to track. My favorite song on this album is ""I survived you""My only complaint to this CD, is that many of the songs sound the same. However, clay did a good job vocally on the songs, and many people will enjoy this CD!"
2660,5,Timeless Music From a Singer That Sings From The Heart,"It's been many years since I've been this moved by a singer and the songs he sings are straight from his heart and touch the soul with it's magic. The songs Clay sings, his heart and his voice cross the generation ""gap"" (my daughter and parents also enjoy Clay's style and voice) and truly can be enjoyed by all. This CD is one you can sing to, slow dance to and love to both now and in the future.... it truly is a timeless and classic treasure."
2661,2,Not A Good Introduction,"I knew nothing about struts before picking up this book. I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction."
2662,2,"Good Start but, ...","Good start. But, sort of slumps downward and never comes back.Might be ok as a reference."
2663,4,why this cd compilation was necessary,"This compilation is a pretty good mix of their best songs. I would have bought the original cds instead, but they don't seem to sell ""Don't Tread"" anymore. They are rereleasing it in May. The nice thing about this compilation is that it made me look at the songs from ""Damn Yankees"" again and I was surprised to find that I like more songs from it than I had originally had. If you like good rock 'n' roll, buy this disk. If you like it, buy ""Don't Tread"" in May. It is definitely worth the money. There are some good rockers on it that aren't on ""Essentials."""
2664,3,If You Own....,"If you already own ""Damn Yankees"", and ""Don't Tread"" CD's, there is no need to buy this ""Best Of"" release. If you don't own either of the CD's, this has all the songs you will need. It would have been nice, (in this compilation), if there was something new that didn't make it to either original CD's. That is why I'm only giving this CD, 3 stars. To bad Ted, Tommy, Jack & Michael didn't give us another release. If or when they ever do, crank up this or either of the only 2 original CD's, and enjoy true American musicians, doing what they do best...playing good solid kick ass rock & roll!"
2665,2,Was this necessary?,"I guess they will put out a greatest hits album for about anybody now. This ""supergroup"" put out 2 albums and really had only one big hit in ""High Enough"". It is here and there are a few other good tracks, but nothing to write home about. This is the work that Tommy Shaw did after his first falling out with Dennis DeYoung and it has influenced him ever since. this band is a major reason why STYX is without DeYoung and the joke of the classic rock world today."
2666,3,Do not be deceived!,Beowulf was NEVER a 'christian' story!!! It was written long before Europe was 'converted' at sword-point. I suppose that christians were also the firt to tell the tale of a great flood too??? (apologies to gilgamesh).It is a rather weak retelling- but if it gets children interested in reading about real heros- that's stilll a goood thing.
2667,5,This Is An Awesome Book!,"I liked this book a lot. It converted ancient history into what people love to read these more modern days. I'm a 7th grade student in Indiana. I read all the time, but this is one of the best books i've ever read.it's really hard to believe this used to be ancient folklore. I recommend this book to all people who like a good book."
2668,2,iLuv 702 FM transmitter on Nano,Dies after Nano battery is about 75% of full charge. Excellent sound quality when it works.
2669,4,Deep Fried Texas Soul,"Vastly underrated and underrecorded Texas soul and funkster's 1960's recorded output for Huey P. Meaux's Crazy Cajun label. Medwick, was employed as staff songwriter for Don Robey's Duke/Peacock label during the 50's and 60's where he penned several hit records for Bobby ""Blue"" Bland including, ""Further On Up The Road"" & ""Cry Cry Cry"". Although, known less for his singing then his songwriting abilities, Medwick proves beyond a dobt that he's got the vocal chops. Medwick, convincingly tackles everything from the guttiest of gut wrenching ballad's to sanctified soul numbers, Texas funk and r&b. This disc is certainly worth it's weight in soul, My only complaint would be the sometimes oppresive church organ which challenges rather than compliments Mr. Medwick's efforts. A nice acquisition for lovers of no frills southern soul."
2670,3,Looking for a little more,I'm hoping the second episode delivers the real goods on these 2 main characters! These are a couple of my 2 favorite actors.
2671,4,Good entertainment.,Amazon service and playback works great. The show I like but I have a soft spot for period pieces. The story lines are predictable but in a good way.
2672,4,Good Stuff,"I picked this out of the bargain bin at Amoeba Records, in San Francisco. For a buck, I thought, hey, why not? I can still afford a couple of Crimson and Sabbath discs. Turned out that this record became one of my favorite listens. I can't even start to describe the genre, I just go with what I like. The ingredients include: One heartbroken girl, singing hearttugging songs, a guitar with enough fuzz to sand wood, steel-corded bass(very little thump, presumably to let the notes go through,) lilting sustain-driven keys, and snappy drum sounds. To try to embellish any more aspects of their sound technically would be foolish. I will say this, however. Their interpretation of the ""The little drummer boy"" is one-of-a-kind. Ah rum pumpum pum... rum pumpum pum...."
2673,5,A great collection from Richard,"Richard D. James, the mastermind behind Caustic Window now has a collection of tracks from various Caustic releases that are very hard to find. With this disc, you can get a lot of what youre missing! Bizzare, trippy, funny, and sci-fi worlds of electronika is what you fly into while listening to Caustic Window Compilation. Those with open minds about music, and have patience for the infinite world of electronika, then this album is a must add to your list. If you didn't know, Rich is also the Aphex Twin, Polygon Window, Gak... hes a genuis. He is my #2 all time artist, falling short only to Trent Reznor. Check out Aphex Twin's Ambient Works 85-92. Richard composed this album at the age of 15. Also check out Ambient Works II for a more soothing abd relaxing feel rather than the raw energy emitted by Caustic Window. A definite reccomendation!"
2674,2,maybe better kept unpublished,"First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed. A disaster. Which is how I saw ""After the War"" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess. I would rather that my memories of Alice Adams did not include this awful work."
2675,4,"Design Flaws, But Works Great","WARNING: This product contains only one (1) ankle weight.I purchased this product for use with physical therapy from knee surgery.Pros: Works as advertised, comfortable, the design/contour of the arches make for a comfortable fit with shoes on. The adjustable bars make for a good product. Unlike granulated/sand materials that seep into your sock/shoe/pants over time.Cons: There are several design flaws that come to mind. For one, the one strip of velcro is all there is to hold the 10lbs. One would think a belt loop would give added support. When not using all 10lbs, the excess velcro strap is in the way and does not stay down. The entire ankle weight slips up and when doing leg lifts (the entire ankle weight, not the bars themselves)."
2676,2,"Some good features, some bad.","The ability to adjust the weight of this product is great. The BIG disappointment is the velcro strap, which I can't believe will last long, especially as I begin to add more weights. I think this product would have been far better if the ankle weight came with an adjustable strap with a plastic buckle closure. Then you would adjust once and just simply buckle the strap when you put it on. This feature is especially critical when you're trying to put the weight on your ""bad"" leg and struggling to get it snug with the long unwieldy velcro strap. I can not recommend this device with this strap mechanism."
2677,3,Slips around ankle,"It is easy to adjust the weights to get the desired pounds. The problem for me is that I use them for leg lifts and the weights slip around my ankle; therefore, the weight is not equally distributed."
2678,3,It has charm....but at what cost?,"It must have been about 5 years ago or so that I bought this album. I listened to it fairly regularly for about a month, and it fit well in my summer listening rotation. I enjoyed the inherent charm of this bedroom-recorded affair. Bikeride doesn't overdo anything: handclaps, whistling, horns. But perhaps that's the problem. If you haven't heard it, maybe a good way to describe it is on par with 3rd generation Elephant 6 bands. But wait - they predate those bands, so I guess you could say they were the first of the 3rd generation to pray at the altar of the Beach Boys. The album is most certainly a little bit twee, but I went through that important stage in my emotional devlopment (what a confessional review this has become). By the end of the summer the album found its way underneath my bed. Being stuffed in a trash can for the second time by my roommates was a good catalyst for change."
2679,3,"Nice album, not the best of EC",Not the best album but a good one. Great invitations on it as Ron Wood & Bob Dylan.My points 3 out of 5.-
2680,5,Great Read,This is one of the greatest SF/Fantasy books ever written I more than enjoyed this book it sits up there on my book shelf alongside Stranger in a Strange Land - magic.
2681,2,Don't bother with this one.,"Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to ""old earth"", even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about ""sam"" or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."
2682,4,Always entertaining,"...To avoid repetition, I won't repeat the details of the story.While it's not as easy a read as his Amber series - the story seems more dense somehow, maybe because it's all in one book - Zelazny's dialogue still sparkles and his humor is still as sharp. While it's not exactly hard-core SF, it's an entertaining read, full of surprises, epic moments, and memorable characters.I was recommended this book by a friend who said I remind him of Yama (the God of Death character in this book). I'm not sure what he meant, but I assume he meant it as a compliment somehow. That's what sticks with me about this book. Hope that helps."
2683,5,An awesome book,"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years, and Zelazny remains one of my favourite authors. His style may not suit everyone: the pace can be quick and he often gives you brief allusions to things you never hear much more about. It's a part of the way he creates a world, by giving his characters a story and a history beyond that which is set down in the actual novel.Zelazny didn't always get it right - for example, I found ""Eye of Cat"" very hard to follow - but I think he's done it perfectly in ""Lord of Light"". It gives a powerful beauty and poignancy to both the beginning and the end of the novel, while the imagination and presentation of the magic/technology remains as consistent and fresh today as when he wrote the novel in the 1960s. This novel has a permanent place on my bookshelf."
2684,5,One of the Best,"Without question one of the finest SF novels ever written, by one of the absolute masters. If you have never read this book, find it and buy it and read it and read it again. This is such a rich, rewarding novel that once is simply not enough to appreciate the brilliance that flashes from every facet.Heaven is a much more interesting place now, and the world is a bit more mundane, with his passing."
2685,2,Didn't work for me,"Maybe I would have loved this when I was in college? My 13-year-old son turned me on to this book. He loved it but to be honest, the first half of the book seemed to be intentionally confusing and unexplained. I was too tired to take the rest of it seriously. I sped through it slowing down to wonder about the significance the character spouting the sermon on the mount near the end. I'm giving it two stars to show my lack of enthusiasm in the first reading. Since my son liked enough to get the hardback for his 'best books' collection, I feel bound to give it another chance some day."
2686,2,Stay away from U3,"My flash drive stopped working after I plugged it on a Windows Vista machine. After that, I couldn't even format it. I had to install and uninstall U3 three times to (luckly!) revive it. This drive now is in probation mode until I can trust on it again to keep important data.Just google ""u3 cruzer format problem"" and you'll understand the problem."
2687,5,fits my Bosch BSA2101UC canister,My Bosch BSA2101UC canister that I picked up at a pretty reasonable price does a great job but began expelling stinky exhaust. The exhaust comes out the top directed towards the user so I thought I'd try one of these. It did solve the problem but it sure is an expensive solution. The smell might be caused by our 2 dogs although we keep them regularly washed and I don't notice a smell until I vacuum.
2688,3,Not very fun,My little girl (18mos) and my 3 year old son have shown no interest in this toy. I can not say that I blame them. It is just not a fun toy for children to interact with. It has been shoved to the back of their toys and not played with at all.
2689,1,Farm or Blocks?,"This toy is quite small. I think when you see this toy, should think if you are going for the block or farm concept. Whichever one it is, either get another farm toy or blocks. (Mega Blocks) Also animals roam, they don't jump, so when child plays they wouldn't naturally want to stick the animal in the block numerous times to get where they are going. Just my thoughts."
2690,3,"Rather tepid, considering its subject matter....","It's hard to believe that you can make a tepid documentary out of the Jonestown massacre, but that's exactly what we have here. The film is interesting solely because of its subject matter, not because of its presentation. The documentary ends up being very superficial, covering things in a very quick, piecemeal way, and there is precious little new information that I haven't read and/or seen before. The only thing that I didn't know was that Jones's church was one of the most integrated churches during its time (with a mostly black congregation), and this caused much consternation during Jones's time in Indiana. The interviews are interesting and sad (many of the subjects lost relatives in the massacre), but there's nothing particularly new here, and for such a fascinating, tragic subject, you'd figure the filmmaker could come up with more material. There's a better film to be made out there about Jim Jones, Jonestown, and the People's Temple."
2691,4,"Good, but could have been great.","This documentary is well made, but I feel bad for anyone who saw only the film and didn't see the DVD. Without the deleted scenes, which explain how some of the members escaped and what happened to them afterwards, the film makes even less sense, and frankly, there are many questions left unanswered. For example, why Guyana? We never hear how or why Jones chose that country to establish Jonestown. At 90 minutes, the film should at least be re-cut to include the deleted scenes, and could have gone much further in its exploration of People's Temple. That said, it's well done and interesting to watch."
2692,5,Very insightful devotional,"I haven't completed the book yet, but so far have found it to be very insightful and enjoyable. It begins in Genesis and continues from there hitting on the most commonly read Bible sections to the not so often or seldom read sections. He ends everyday with a thought provoking question to think on through out the rest of your day. I always look for to the next reading."
2693,4,great easy book of all bible stories,"This book is about all the main stories from the bible with a commentary after each by yancey and quinn, it is a very easy introduction to the bible and easy to read for anyone, especially those who find the bible tough going. I brought this book for my husband on the recommendation of 40yr male,and he was right, my husband loves it has brought one for his friend and is still reading it months after I brought it. A great book to read completely through, to get a good knowledge of the bible"
2694,3,Vanilla,"Although at times very engaging, it wasn't as captivating for me as the Arthur or the Hood series. But the author's grasp of Celtic ways, terms,and places is wonderful, and sometimes subtle."
2695,2,The book can be half of its size!,"I'm sure the otherworld is absolutely beatiful but do we have to spent soooo many pages describing it?! The plot moves along soooo slow, I almost didn't finish reading it. Now that I did, I wish I didn't waste my time."
2696,1,yuk!,one of the few books that i just couldn't make myself finish. so bored after reading a third book i just couldnt make myself read any more.'
2697,1,The Paradise War,"I wanted to like this book but it seemed to shuffle on and not land anywhere. It started out so good and then was slow explain what it was like in paradise. I could imagine that if you were a fantasy fan you may be interested in these details but alas, I was not...skip it."
2698,4,Good book but I've seen it's type before,Much of the material is familiar to me as I recall reading a book about King Kong back in the 90's that was a lot like this one. I do not recall the other book's title but I feel certain this book deliberately draws heavily from it. This book goes back and forth between the different Kong films a little too much (it would have been better to keep the descriptions of the films in more sequential order) but it is very imformative just the same.
2699,3,not what i expected,The belt turned out to be not what I expected. While it worked great for the first two weeks one of the grommets fell out of the belt. Coincidentally it's the same spot where I'd buckle the belt when wearing it. Otherwise it was very comfortable to wear and work with. I do wish that CLC replaced one of the hammer loops with a clip for a tape measure as I use FatMax tapes that don't fit into the pouches very well. At this time I'm trying to get it exchanged for a different model belt.
2700,3,Sanctuary the complete second season BluRay,"Unfortunbately cannot review as although the BluRay Packaging shows as valid for zones A, B and C It will not play in Zone B so money has been wasted My advice to people is if buying BluRay from Amazon be very careful as the labeling on the packageing may not be correct and you may purchase a product that that will not play in your zone even the laleling indicates that it is valid for all zones."
2701,5,Should serve as the basis for a required course in every Seminary,Well written - fast read - thoughtful - excellent footnotes.Clearly and forcefully refutes much of the fuzzy thinking of the last fifty years.
2702,5,No other name upon which humankind may be saved,"It used to be typical for the majority of Evangelical Christians to insist that the true Jesus (2 Cor. 11:4) was the only way to God, as all other ways fell short. John 14:6 used to have meaning to the church. However, in recent years, the meaning about the exclusivity of Jesus have blurred, as many have turned to pluralism or, at best, inclusivisim (Jesus can be found innately in other faiths).In this book, James Edwards deals with the issue head on. Indeed, he holds to the conservative position that a true relationship with Christ is vital to one's standing before God. In the last chapters, he hits Postmodernism head on and also talks about what to do with other monotheistic faiths such as Judaism. His conclusion? We should continue to preach the gospel to everyone who does not have a personal relationship with Christ. I, for one, am glad to see this scholar hold such a view, and think the book is worth a look."
2703,3,Deceiving work,"Well, I consider that previous works where really better. In this CD we can find to remakes(Taa Dem and Rebel Warrior), and they are the better songs of the CD!I'm a little bit deceived. It seems like they are trying new beats and rythms but ,in my opinion, they still have a lot of work to do. I liked a lot Fictions and Facts, Rafi's and Conscious Party. All previous CD's where on the same line: mixing New Dance Trends with amazing asian sounds and REALLY POWERFUL lyrics.The lyrics are still strong and with a lot of meaning, but the music is not so exciting for me."
2704,3,better than other marai's,"i really gave it an honest shot, but i am not a fan of marai in general. he was a master of making you feel like you are on the hungarian border: lots of tension over what is to come, but nothing comes in the end."
2705,2,Not the best...,"I usually wear a size 7 and purchased a size 7. They fit OK. I do get a little bit of room in the back of the heels. I have definitely had more comfortable heels than these. I'm used to wearing heels, but these are some of the most uncomfortable I own."
2706,4,Better than Previous,This cd contains 23 tracks of Southern Rap. Wich can be sometimes annoying but Silkk Comes through with this one.
2707,5,Sylvia Brown's Book of Dreams,I enjoyed this book very much especially the chapter on Astral Visits. I have experienced this but didn't know what it was. This book is filled with lots of information and Sylvia never disappoints me.
2708,3,Dream a little dream of me,"Sylvia gives her interpretation of dreams in general - from our screaming nightmares to running on a sun-kissed beach. If you want a simple explanation of what did last nights dream mean, this isn't the book for you. I like it, but most of my questions still aren't answered."
2709,2,Book of Dreams,I was a bit disappointed in this book. The beginning started out well and then I lost interest in the subject matter.
2710,4,A Classic Endures,"I love Rangonis, and this shoe is no exception. The style is classic, works well with slacks or skirts or jeans, and it feels great!"
2711,5,"Good price, good product","This is the most comfortable tennis elbow support on the market. For the money, the set of two is a great deal!"
2712,2,I could make something better myself,I have the Bandit product and got another one but wanted something that I can alternate and wear at work without looking like a lost squash player.This did not give me any relief and after adjusting it every which way it just did not cut the mustard. The only time it gave me relief was when it also kept blood flowing to my fingers.I would give it one star but I am going to use it as a fancy - and pricey - cuff guard instead so I don't get chain grease on my trousers.
2713,4,Awesome,"This product is great!There was a thunderstorm in which i had other screen tents break, but this one stood strong Although it doesnt come with directions to put it together it pretty straight forward"
2714,5,Good bedtime book for baby,"We have been reading this book at bedtime toour 7 month old baby. He loves to hold the book andlook at the glowing pictures. There is one sentenceper page, and they rhyme nicely, ""Sun sets, crickets chirp,day has turned to night. Stars twinkle up above, housesglowing bright."""
2715,1,Thank Your for the warning,"I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket. Thanks all for the warning. Bill Blass, Hmmmmmmm, I thought they made quality merchandize. Live and learn."
2716,4,"Thin, but worth the price","If you wear dress shirts to work everyday, you might choose to pick up a few ""cheapies"" for some days. These shirts fit well, the measurements seem to be accurate (mine were 16.5 34/35) and in line with many of my ""brand name"" shirts. They are however thin, a nice clean undershirt is a must. That being said, they are good value for money, especially if you tend to stain shirts often... cheap enough to throw away, nice enough to wear to the office."
2717,2,"Below average shirts, nice stitch","Paid around 10 bucks for the shirt, but its not wort 10 bucks at all, cant wear to office cos the cloth is see thru. very thin cloth."
2718,1,"Terrible shirt, low quality and bad fit.","All I can say is don't waste your money.This has to be one of the worst shirts I have ever purchased.It looks nice in the pictures, but in this case looks can be deciving. Flimsy material, and the collar appears to be simply paper inside."
2719,1,DONT EVER BUY THIS SHIRT,The shirt is NOT at all of a good quality. It does not worth $6 at all. Its transparent also. Please save your money and buy a better quality shirt.
2720,4,CRANK IT UP,"GOOD CONCERT, LOTS OF THE HITS. WISH I KNEW WHAT HE WAS SAYING IN GERMAN THOUGH. OVERALL GOOD CONCERT. GREAT TO SEE FORMER MEMBERS. GREAT DVD FOR THE MONEY."
2721,4,The same great band on stage,"A great band always give you excellent music. A good review of their best hits, including their previous players. I just hate the camera moving. You can't see nothing. Every take last half second. When they are doing solos the camera is taking everything but the player. In spite of this, good video."
2722,5,Uncle Tom,"This is a touching story of a boy whose mother abuses him during World War II. William is sent to live with a man named Tom, who lives in the country. As William slowely settles in he and Tom become the best of friends. Then one day he is sent back to his mother, who beats him and locks him in the cellar. Uncle Tom follows William and finds him and gets him to a hospital. They then get to live together. This is an exccelent book. I would reccomend it to EVERYONE!!!"
2723,4,Super Reader,"A group of men come to misfortune at sea. They have the dubious misfortune to come to the attention of Captain Nemo and his highly advanced submarine, Nautilus. While this prevents them from drowning, they do get caught up with some of the odd Captain's other pursuits. Ned and company do certainly get some education in oceanography and marine biology along the way.They do have to worry about what the antiheroic supergenius Nemo is actually up to, though."
2724,5,Falt like I was right there,This story was a fast pace adventure that kept stretching your imagination to great measures.I would defidently recomend this book to everyone with a taste for adventure.
2725,2,Good first half -- extremely dissappointing end,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. I had to read it for a school assignment, and I was liking it. Once it got past the first halh, the book's plot went downhill. Majorly!!! I think it had a very disappointing end."
2726,1,I only gave it 1 because you can't give it 0.,"Don't get it. It was the worst $[amount] I ever spent on something. It has an impossible-to-follow story line and a boring, boring, plot. Classical? Harry Potter's more Classical than this. Save your $[amount], buy gum or something, I don't know."
2727,2,"Volume changes, two tapes not understandable","I was hoping to introduce my teens to Jules Verne while traveling; so, I ordered the audio cassettes. However, on most of the tapes, the volume would suddenly go down to be almost inaudible. The quality of two of the cassettes was so bad that only about 1/4 of the tape could be understood."
2728,1,Very Hard to understand.,"I gave this book this raiting because it was hard to understand. The words were very hard and I didn't know any of them. The book did have a good plot but they made it to hard to know what it meant. This book did teach us about sea life, which was the ONLY thing in my opinion. I would only reccomend this book for highschoolers."
2729,2,Interesting but Repetative,"While reading this book I was extremely fascinated and into it in the beginning. But as the book goes on, the main character continues to classify underwater creatures over and over and over. The only thing that kept me reading until the end was the mystery of Captain Nemo (which i have to say, was never really revealed, and a bit disapointing ending). So all together, and VERY detailed and interesting book, but too slow and boring overall."
2730,3,alright,i thoght thisbook was okay it was a tad bit boring thogh it had its exciting parts but i feel it could have had more action and suspece.
2731,5,Verne Classic,Story perhaps more relevant today than we realize at first glance. Passions controlled yet unleashed in righteous indignation are prevalent both yesterday and today.
2732,4,Bought from Amazon for my kindle,"A classic book I never read. Totally enjoyed reading or perhaps re-reading it. I saw the movie many times, and several different versions. A joy to finally read the real story as written. Even after all these years I could not put it down and intend to re- read it often!"
2733,2,Too dull through most of the story,"I agree with most of the other reviews in the sense that there are four or five scenes in this book that get your heart-pumping. Unfortunately that accounts for about a quarter of the book. The rest is full of detailed descriptions of sea life that would appeal to the most passionate environmentalist. The story was interesting, but you have to plow through a lot of boring text. Have a pot of coffee ready!"
2734,1,Beautiful packaging - but the translation is terribly flawed.,"For those who, like me, have found great pleasure in surrounding oneself with great literary works, the Easton Press edition books seem to have a lot of draw. However, it has been my experience that many of their novels by foreign authors can be found to contain older and flawed translations.This specific Easton Press contains the Mercier 1873 translation that edits out 25% of the original text. The major flaws in this translation led to a slew of critiques by the scientific and literary communities (that did not refer to the original French).Fortunately now there is a new version:Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea/Completely Restored and Annotated. This translation is true to the original text that shows Verne's actual correct calculations as well as including the 25% of the text lost to English readers for over a century. Happy reading.Peace, Ben"
2735,3,Details were sometimes tedious,"I read this after reading ""Mysterious Island"" just to get the background story. I think that Verne must have been a botanist and/or marine biologist - he goes into SO much detail on fauna and aquatic wildlife. This distracted from the story for me, I often found myself skipping pages just to get back to the journey."
2736,5,Dynamite songs here!!!!,"This year of 2005 is very young, a couple of months, but this is one of best I've heard of the new music of the new year! Brian McKnight really tops himself with Gemini. This album focuses on a live sound and it shows on many songs. Everything I Do (with its similar Bryan Adams song title in the chorus) is the best song here, as Brian shows that falsetto a lot on this song! A couple of the songs, he sounds eerily close to Marvin Gaye. Because Brian is so true to his music, writing and producing his own songs, this album is one of his best. I like his hip-hop driven songs with Talib Kweli, Juvenile and others, and he has his own heavy beats on those songs! Brian does his own Dr. Dre thing on these few songs! The final number is dramatic and very timely for the Lent season of some religions. Brian's song about Jesus on this final song is moving and emotional. This album just shows Brian McKnight at the top of his music game. I hope this album has a lot of hits soon!"
2737,2,Weak,I waited many months for this album to drop and when I finally bought it whenit came out I was very dissapointed! I give it 2 stars to stand for the only 2 songs worth a second listen. What we do here is a decent song . Everytime you Go Away is an amazing song but doesn't keep this album from sinking.
2738,2,Needs rebooting several times a day.,"Works well when the modem initially connects to the provider CO. Wireless seems to work well. NAT functionality seems good. However, within minutes to hours, the connection to the CO slows to a virtual stand still. Cycling the power makes the problem go away for a while, if you can put up with doing that every few hours. Firmware upgrades so far have contained empty and unrealized hopes of fixing this problem. You may feel like you've been taken advantage of by the manufacture if you buy this modem after reading on the box how wonderful the product is."
2739,4,Good Combo!,"The Zoom X6 is a good combo if you are wanting a little less clutter on your desk. I did not have much luck with the install disk though, I went online and found the users manual to get it set up. Works very nicely indeed. Would have rated it a 5 if the install software worked. The speed of my connection is great for both my ADSL service and wireless network."
2740,1,Look before you leap,"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The ""story"" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."
2741,3,Zweibel's phraseology threw my back out,"My favorite bit of commentary is from the shlub named after a German onion.ALAN ZWEIBEL: ""It's like when I was doing Garry Shandling's first series, we wanted to have Shari Lewis and Lamb Chop on. I said, 'Of course we'll fly you out', and she said, 'Well, what about Lamb Chop?' What *about* Lamb Chop?!? She says that Lamb Chop gets a seat. I swear to God, I almost threw my back out giving her the benefit of the doubt that she wasn't insane. I laughed and she said, 'Lamb Chop doesn't sit in the back'. I said, 'If I'm not mistaken, are we talking about the same Lamb Chop? Because, you know, it's a sock! It's a sock with a button, okay?!?' And it ended up we didn't use her because it was too insane."""
2742,2,It deviated a lot from the book,"Really, the title of my review is my review. The movie deviated a lot from the book and being a lover of Narnia, that was very disappointing to me. I hate what they did to Peter's character, I was annoyed by the added ""love interest"" and most importantly, Aslan was often left out. I love in the book the picture of faith and trust with Lucy having to decide whether to follow Aslan even when noone else believed her that he was there. That was not fully addressed in the movie - I suppose cut in leu of more battle scenes and false tension between Peter and Caspian. sigh. A very pretty movie though - I loved the river god - just sadly altered."
2743,5,+Great Family movie!,This was a purchase for family movie night. I was very pleased my husband even enjoyed watching!
2744,2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Repeating the formula of the moderately-better ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" (poor CGI, lots of religious references, and uneven performances) but with a worse script and a terrible turn by Ben Barnes as a hunky European version of the film's title character, Prince Caspian not only fails as a self-contained film, but bodes very poorly for the franchise."
2745,1,Wasted my money,The disc was a region 1 and i cudnt watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!! And i could not change my Samsung player to multi region.
2746,3,Movie was great!,I screwed up with this one and didn't read everything. I didn't read the fact that it was a disc only which was not good. The movie played great!!! I just wish I would have read the fact that it didn't come in a case.
2747,1,Thanks for the case,I was disappointed with this seller. I got an empty DVD case that was shrink wrapped. The most frustrating part about it was I never received a response back from the seller after trying to get in contact over and over again. There goes my hard earned cash!
2748,1,terrible quality when it did play,Let me start with my internet connection was great. I checked my connection and my settings 7 times. And I had rented another movie from Amazon and it played flawlessly. And just to be absolutely sure I rented yet another movie(all 48 HR paid movies) and that one worked perfect. At least 10 times I for a error message saying you are having trouble playing this title please try again or choose another movie. Or you are unable to view this movie etc... When it did play it was terrible quality. Or a scene would freeze up but the audio still continued. Very dissapointed.
2749,1,Disappointing sequel,"This sequel is greatly inferior to the first movie. Where the first one had an interesting story, nice atmospheric environment with the ice world, and a sense of awe, this sequel is almost nothing but fights and chases. Very dull."
2750,3,"for what it was, it was pretty good","But the thing that had me checking out emotionally was the assault on the castle about midway through the movie. I just wasn't buying that the army of beasts and birds would have been repulsed:1. The main army was supposed to have been bivouacked somewhere, leaving the castle thinly defended.2. Element of surprise intact: the castle defenders were supposed to be sleeping, yet here here they all were suited up lickety-split in chain mail!3. The soldiers would have been freaked out seeing centaurs and talking mice.4. The gryphons should have been lending some formidable assist, yet after depositing their cargo, they pretty much disappeared.5. A key commander, Prince Caspian, knew the castle grounds intimately and would have been able to brief his troops superbly.Because I couldn't take the result of this battle seriously, I was unable to take the rest of the movie seriously and so kept watching the minutes count down until it ended."
2751,3,Prince Caspian review,"We chose this for our grandson as he had enoyed 'The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe'. Unfortunately this was beyond his comprehension and did not therefore capture his imagination. It will keep until he is older, he is 5 years old."
2752,2,Disappointing - stick with the 1st movie,"I purchased this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He has the first movie and has watched it numerous times. After we watched this movie I asked how he liked it. His response was same as mine. We give this a D rating, at best, a C. I have a feeling he won't be watching this over and over again."
2753,4,Story doesn't follow the book all that well.,"There was an allusion to a romance between two of the characters that was not in the book at all. Also not in the book was an entire sequence with a character from the first movie. Many things were completely out of chronological order from the original story. Those things said. It was an overall good movie adaptation of the story. Mostly you come away with the same message as the original. If you enjoyed the book you will probably enjoy the movie, provided you realize the story is similar, but enough changed that (beyond the obvious differences between books and films) it is a different experience."
2754,4,Great sequel,"This 2nd installment in the Narnia movie franchise picks up one year after the end of the first movie; in England time. When our four heroes return to Narnia, it is actually a millenium later. But the ensuing movie is just as exciting as the first one, with even some romance thrown in at the end. Like any good fantasy movies, Prince Caspian has several grand battle scenes, creatures of various species interacting with each other in English, great swordfighting, and some double-crossing, both by good guys and by the bad guys. All in all, a great 2+ hours of movie-watching experience. Some of the movie does take part in the night, so turn of the lights while watching it."
2755,1,Wretched,"C.S. Lewis has to be rolling over in his grave, as this pathetic adaptation abandons his story early on and turns into a smarmy, boring CGI exercise. Pointless battles, pointless special effects, flat characters, ridiculous dialog and no sense of wonder at all. The film invents half baked soap opera subplots that go nowhere. I can't imagine a worse film adaptation. Prince Caspian is the weakest of the Narnia books, but it is a jewel compared to this dreck."
2756,2,caspian falls short,"It is unfortunate that there was not a ""C.S. Lewis"" fan club to keep an eye on these movie makers like the Lord of the Rings fans did. There are many beauties and strengths of the Narnia series so far, but in Caspian, the departure from the novel changes the story in an extremely unfortunate way. There is no real justification for the filmmakers' changing the story, it is change for the sake of change. They could have adhered more closely to the book without losing anything. Caspian was my favorite book of the series, and the movie is terribly disappointing. Peter and Caspian were allies, not antagonists. For the sake of ""high concept,"" the filmmakers have pretty much gutted the story. Good luck with all that. We are stuck with this version now, in the sequence. The actors continue to be good, but the story has been altered for no apparent reason. Sorry, I wish I could have liked this more. There was a lot of potential."
2757,4,We Were Soldiers review.,I have not watched this movie for about 4 yrs but I remember it being very moving in how it portrayed the sacrifice a person makes in leaving home and family to physically fight an enemy who is determined to take away another culture's right and ability to live in a society with a democratic level of the right to choose for oneself one's future and present. I met a man recently who said he had been in the battle portrayed in this film and he felt the movie was pretty accurate in capturing the intensity and brutality and terror of it.
2758,5,The Chronical of Narnia - Prince Caspian,I gave this DVD to one of my God-daughters as a Christmas gift. We watched it with the whole family and we all enjoyed seeing the movie. It is nice for young children to see and learn the battle between good and evil and watch good to prevail.
2759,3,I liked it,I liked it but I don't have much to say about it. It was good and I would buy it. The Dawm Treader movie was the least liked movie of all the movies to date but I would still buy it.
2760,3,"Don't know how it compares to book, visually great","I've bought all three Narnia movies, just this one from Amazon, and perhaps the best thing about this one and the others is how beautiful it looks, the story is also interesting. I don't know what sort of career young actress Georgie Henley will have in later years but I liked what I saw here.Pay attention to the special features disc, that'll be we'll worth your time."
2761,5,OMG,"OMG!! This was TERRIFIC! I was so pleased that all the actors/actresses from ""TL, TW, ATW"" came back to Prince Caspian!!! It was awesome... the sword fights, the battles, the waking of the trees, Reepicheep, and the bits of humor mixed in here and there! I loved it!"
2762,4,Got it back,I lost this CD a while back & was never able to find it so I'm glad I was able to download it. Now I have a permanent digital copy of a lot of my favorite reggae tunes.
2763,5,A great resource,"This is a great knot resource; compact, durable, very accessible, and well designed. You can't go wrong."
2764,4,From Longy,I'm never surprised by anything Connie Francis does. In this album she takes on the greats from Patsy Cline to Hank Williams and does not disappoint. Well worth the purchase for any Connie Francis and Country fan.
2765,5,A new perspective,"A groundbreaking work with a new perspective on how to achieve successful outcomes in business. I use the Smart Spot techniques daily.Nancy Copeland, President, Copeland Strategies"
2766,5,"""My Favorite Book""","We had seen a fantastic theatrical production of The Wind and the Willows at Imagination Stage in Bethesda. My 6 year old granddaughter was mesmerized. I had seen the book in the gift shop and was very impressed with the illustrations. I decided to give it to her for a Christmas gift. I did worry that this edition is abridged, but the other reviews convinced me that it really was not a problem. She declared it her favorite book and her Mom reports that she takes it into her ""tent"" to read and really seems to be enjoying it."
2767,1,Deceptive presentation,"This product is abridged and not what I wanted. If Amazon wishes to sell an abridged version of a product the word ""ABRIDGED"" should be at the top of the page in big flashing letters, not buried somewhere."
2768,2,Sharp looking but quite thin!,"My husband doesn't like to wear shirts under his dress shirts; however, he will have to with these. I ordered 2 whites and 1 tan. They are nice looking but very, very thin. The retail tags say $45. I'd be quite upset if I had paid that much! I guess for $9.99, they'll be okay. I didn't save a lot though cause now I have to buy some new t-shirts to wear underneath! If you don't have a white-collar job, these would be fine (at a reasonable price) for occassional wear. However, my husband has to wear them everyday, and I doubt they will hold up well since they are so thin."
2769,1,Boots,"The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.Drop ya boots, dawg!!!It"
2770,3,Not yet convinced,"I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however. The work often seems a little bit on the acquiescent side to me."
2771,5,A wonderful book,I found this book both enlightening and informative. I had no knowledge of this institution and had only heard of Mr. Booker T. Washington in my history class some 46 years ago. Easy reading.
2772,5,An inspiration,"This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded. Booker T. Washington exemplified the American spirit."
2773,2,High Mountain but a flat book,What an amazing accomplishment! I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. If you want a really good book read Into thin Air or Seven Summits.
2774,1,A Great Story; A Bad Book,"After reading ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer and ""The Climb"" by Anatoli Boukreev with G. Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to ""Facing the Extreme"" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."
2775,2,Not Good,"I picked up this book from my library because the cover looked interesting and the blurb looked interesting. The book consists more musings and less research and organization. The author begins to tell a story or talk about a myth or idea, and then jumps from topic to topic, and we never see the end of her train of thought.I stopped reading around Chapter 3, when the book turned to the ""taboo"" of being a redhead in the Elizabethan era without any mention of Queen Elizabeth being a redhead - not to mention that red hair during this time was actually quite fashionable."
2776,1,Sleep-Inducing at best.,"This book poses somewhat of a conundrum. Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise? The answer: it is both! It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa. Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep. If you are in need of a never-ending supply of sleep medication, save yourself some money and buy this book. If not, don't bother."
2777,3,REDHEADS UNITE!,"This book was written by a woman, for women. I enjoyed the parts of the book that explained the science and history of red hair."
2778,4,Take the Ride!,"Get ready to ride through history, science,lore, myth and fun stuff about redheads. It takes one to know one! I have recommended this book to other redheads, and will continue to do so. And yes, we are different!"
2779,5,A GREAT BOOK!,"A VREY GOOD BOOK. I like the inventions that Alvin made and how the book was written. It was neat how Alvin solved the mystery with his great inventions. I reccommand this book to you if you enjoy reading mystery books. So go to the bookstore and but it, Right Now!"
2780,2,Misaligned Parts,"Under the table surface, there are two factory-assembled bars used to connect the four legs. Clearly the bars on my table were misaligned, as they almost stick out of the table surface at one end (I will upload a photo for that), and left no room for the legs. This rendered the whole table useless.It surprised me how such a defected part could get through the manufacturer's quality control. You don't need any fancy tool to discover it. Looking at it would suffice.Finally I chose to fix it myself. It was not very difficult for me, just taking off the 6 screws that hold the bars, realigning the bars to the correct position, and then put the screws back in again. The extra 20 minutes work was still worth it, comparing to repackaging the whole set, the hassle to ask for a return, plus shopping for another table.The quality of the table (other than the misaligned bars) is OK. That's why I still give it two stars. But I would really hesitate to buy again from this manufacturer."
2781,5,Tombstone Shuffle rises beyond the grave!,"Oh my GOD! This is absolutely the best album I have heard all year! ""Little Queen"" ROCKS! If you don't have this album, you should definately make it part of your collection! Definately your money's worth! And his fan club gives out AWESOME stickers..... KEWL!"
2782,3,Good sun protection but a little greasy,"My title says it all. I like the sun protection but find that my combination skin and the oil content of Eucerin are not necessarily compatible, even in the hottest, low-humidity conditions of Southern California. Haven't given up. Will see how it works in what we call ""winter""."
2783,4,A plain-English version of the life of Jesus.,"This retelling of the life of Jesus, is a simple, straightforward account. It would be very nice for a teenager or useful for a youth minister or a Sunday school teacher of teens and/or young adults.Bible Scholars and readers who enjoy more poetic language and more complexity would probably not enjoy this version; however, I don't think that's who it's intended for! :)I would recommend it for use by and instruction of younger readers and less experienced readers of the Bible."
2784,4,Long Live Robin Hood!,"Just got the collection. Watched it in two consecutive nights. I loved this show from the first time I saw it. Brought back many memories sitting in front of the TV with my Dad watching it. I agree with a follower reviewer, the casing is not great. It's cheap at best. I will be removing the DVD's from the plastic casing and store them in an soft DVD case. ""Robin of Sherwood"" was ahead of it's time. I like the BBC America version of Robin Hood too, but this series had a grittiness to it that made it more believable. The ""pagan"" aspect of the show scared me a little when I first saw it (as a kid), but now I understand the fantasy aspect (I'm talking about the character Gunnar). The acting was incredible. The writing too. I wish the series had continued, but I am glad to own this set, finally."
2785,3,Not much of a surprise ending,"After reading this book, all I can say is ""wow."" That was one long book. It was full of so much information on stocks and when to buy and sell. But the information was not the same old stuff that I have heard before, I was introduced to a whole new theory of buying when everyone else says that you shouldn't because you have sound information on your side. Loeb also talked about putting a good amount of your available money in a smart investment, and watch that investment carefully. A main point that he stressed over and over was not to invest just to invest, only invest when you are going to put in the effort to make money. I thought that it was a difficult book to read because it was about economics, but I think that it might come in handy once I do get money to invest. It was written a long time ago, but I think that the advice that Loeb gives in the book can still be used today."
2786,3,Lacks one important connector: motor-control plug,"I've been pulling my hair trying to find a cassette recorder with two features:-Auto-reverse-Pause-control plug (for microphones with a record/pause switch).So far, all auto-reverse models I found lack this plug.The only currently produced tape recorder I was able to find with a ""pause control"" (aka Mic remote control) plug next to the mic-in is the Casio TP-7, but it lacks a motor/pause control plug.This is a note to manufacturers, why remove a useful feature for those of us who like control the recording from the mic, or use it to record phone calls (with a third party automatic recording control that starts the recording when the phone is in use)?."
2787,4,Importance of nubmer 12,"Well, after reading the book the first time I was amazed how the number 12 is repeated during the history. The book is quite interesting ..."
2788,1,Hex nut driver is not 2.2mm,I purchased this for some rimless glasses that have 2.2mm hexnuts. The driver in the tool is NOT for hex nuts - only star nuts. Do not buy if you have 2.2mm hexnuts - it won't work.
2789,5,SNL Season 32,Excellent item! This is really an amazing item that anyone can buy for their own personal spare time and pleasure..
2790,2,"Great film, lousy print","It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine."
2791,4,Really makes a difference,"We have a multiple pet household and are always working to keep it fresh. Over time, most vacuums start to get a 'dog smell' through the exhaust. I tried other products but this is the one that worked. Highly recommend for anyone with dogs or other issues involving vacuum odors. Note that changing the bag on a regular basis, and rinsing the foam filter pad, is also helpful!"
2792,4,Filter away the doggy smell,I wish this filter came with the vacuum at purchase! With two big German Shepard dogs and endless hair about the house my Bosch vacuum was better at cleaning up after them than any other vacuum. The bags are so big that it takes them a while to fill up. This filter greatly reduces that old vacuum bag doggy smell I used to get. I'm very glad I purchased it. Delivery was very prompt too!
2793,3,NFL Quarterback reflects on childhood,"This book is an attempt by Boomer Esiason to show that his childhood was not much different from any other child's. It is set up like a diary with reflections on many different events in Boomers youth. He relates stories such as giving a girl a valentines gift, fishing with his dad, building and wrecking a fort with his friends, playing baseball with friends and picking the weakest player first, etc.As I was reading this book I thought that a better title might have been ""Random Thoughts of My Childhood by Boomer Esiason"". There just didn't seem to be a point to many of the stories he was sharing, other than his desire to show that he was just a normal kid.Avid young football fans will probably appreciate the end of this book which includes several pages of photographs of Boomer and tells all about his football career."
2794,4,Nice to have on the workbench,"While this isn't a ""must have"" tool for your building bench, it is worth having one around. A nice combination of a ruler, fin guide, and square edge which will keep your door and window jambs from getting marked up as you try to use them to draw the straight lines for your fins."
2795,5,Makes it easier,"This is a relatively inexpensive tool that will make your model making easier and help you avoid the need to be using door frames to draw lines. If you're new to model rockets, or returning after 20 or 30 years as the grown-up, here's the easiest way I can describe why you need this: you're going to be measuring and drawing lines on tubes. They need to be accurate, from end to end. There are plenty of other purposes for this item, but that will probably be the first difficult step you'll face. It's definitely worth having."
2796,3,Not so dumb.,"If you look on the cover it says,' Dumb Dora Edition. The problem with this is there was not one Dumb Dora question on this whole DVD though there is a good thing about it. It is for all of you Michael Landon fans out there as he appears in two Match Game episodes. Brett Somers talks about her time on Match Game in the bonus section. Guests are Michael Landon, Jack Klugman, Vicki Lawrance, Loratta Swit, Mclean Stevenson, Fannie Flag, Eva Gabor, Arte Johnson, Marcia Wallace, Avery Schreiber, Richard Dwson, Charles Nelson Reilly and Betty White.Best of Match Game DVD CollectionIf you care to give this one a shot this has more episodes and of course more laughs."
2797,5,yummy,their not only good for you but their yummy.they smell like cloves when their cooking and taste a little sweet.
2798,4,"Reminds us all to ask, what are we not being told?","Despite the fact that this book is well over 30 years old, it is still right on target. The examples given are a bit dated, but still do a good job in illustrating the principle.You do not need a background in any kind of statistics to understand and appreciate the lessons in this book."
2799,5,Read it and understand,"An old book, but a must read for understanding the world today. Twisted statistics are nothing new, but we are bombarded by them all the time from every media outlet! This old book feels dated and the examples seem even more so, but the message is one we all need, look at the base data, understand the reason behind the author's presentation of the data and think for yourself! Start here and head for some of the newer examples and start to question the reasons behind the statistics."
2800,3,Good but only for beginners,"A friend recommended this book. It is a quick and easy read, and entertaining enough. I'm giving it 3 stars because it really is only for people with very little knowledge of math and statistics. If you've ever taken even a single statistics or probability course, in high school or college, this book isn't for you. You already know everything it tells you. There are a few amusing examples here and there, but beyond that, it doesn't provide any particular insight."
2801,2,Not Impressed,"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."
2802,5,Good News!,"Have already got Waltz Favourites for the accordion so I knew what toexpect from this book. However, like the waltz music it's really good,easy to follow and I'm enjoying playing the many pieces and wouldrecommend it to anyone else. Many thanks"
2803,5,First class! Works great. Folds for Compactness,"We got this for our daughter, she had a high-end Yamaha flue. It fits perfectly on this peg. The idea is not just to hold the flute, but after you are done playing, and you clean the flute, you still want it to really DRY OUT before you put it back in the case. This is the way to go. (Don't leave it flat, someone will sit on your expensive flute, or they'll put a book on it, or worse...)Very Happy. We'll look into adding a peg to this for a piccolo; that will be nice too!"
2804,4,Best of the best in flute stands,"I bought this stand because I needed a stronger stand for my flute just to make sure that during orchestra, band, technical excerpt class, and other musician crowded spaces, my flute would be very safe and it would be harder for it to fall over. This is a great product! I have a gig bag for my flute, and it fits perfectly, but the stand is a little bit bigger and heavier than a regular stand. If you have a really small flute bag, you probably are going to have a hard time fitting it in, but the sure thing is that your flute will be very safe."
2805,5,Janet is 'All For You',"There aren't words enough to express my love for Music's Multi-talented Ms. Janet Jackson. This CD is one of her Top and Best to date. The gritty ""You Ain't Right""(Stupied B***h!), the fun and dance ""All For You"", the pumping heart of ""C'mon Get Up"" to ""Trust A Try"", and favorites ""Doesn't Really Matter"", ""Son Of A Gun"", and ""Someone To Be My Lover"". The CD is jam packed with hits. And with the Bonus Track ""Who""..... the icing on the cake. BUY THIS CD! You won't be sorry."
2806,3,Not really scary.,"This J-Horror flick starring the Japanese actress from Kill Bill vol. 1. Isn't really all that scary, but it's still kind of entertaining."
2807,3,"Solid can, lousy spout","I really don't like the plastic ""spill-proof"" spout that comes with this can. There's a rubber gasket that wants to come out and actually *prevent* the valve from closing, which completely defeats its purpose.This is a very solid can, so I'm glad I bought it. But do yourself a favor and buy the traditional metal spout for it (Blitz 12040 3/4"" Metal Screw On Spout) -- you'll be glad you did."
2808,5,classic (slapstick)comedy,"Its been said that the Three Stooges just werent the same without Curly, and this package has Curly,as well as Moe and Larry.Its a must for every fan and an exceptional bargain!"
2809,1,Horrible!,"Only 4 of the Columbia shorts, one with Curly and three with Shemp. The rest is the cartoon version, Ted Healy shorts with one, two, or three or three of the stooges, and a terrible, amateur documentary. Even the box listing the cast is wrong on the Columbia shorts. It lists Curly Joe DeRita as the star of all of them. Run away from this product, or don't pay more than $2 for it."
2810,1,junk,"junk, waste of money, very disappointed, even misleading as the packaging contains pictures of episodes that are not even in the collection"
2811,1,Disapointed,"When I bought this set from wal-mart, I should have taken my own advice:""Let the buyer beware.""Given the number of shorts the 3 stooges made, the content of this set is lame. How they get away with calling this ""75th anniversary collection"" I'll never know. I enjoyed watching what is on this set-but there's not a whole lot to brag about. ""Kooks ture"" is about the best thing here-but still it's not worth it.Don't buy this set! Now you've been warned."
2812,3,I Was Disappointed,"The video is okay,but it's a fooler. It shows Larry Moe and Curly on the jacket and both films have Shemp instead."
2813,2,boring...,"i had actually purchased this movie at my local target store and i can say you cant judge a movie by its cover, it may look all nice and fancy but there is only a total of 4 stooges episodes on the first dvd, the second dvd are all cartoons and the 3rd is all special features and exclusive interviews with the stooges families, children/grandchildren. extremely disapointed."
2814,4,Fiendishly clever,"Like many reviewers of this book, I also read it about 20 years ago, having already fallen in love with Thomas Tryon's writing in Harvest Home. From the first page of The Other, the haunting and insistent voice of the narrator grips you, and you are ineluctably drawn into his strange, isolated world. The story of the twins Niles and Holland, with its psychologically devastating twist in the tail, has haunted me ever since I first read it, and having lost my copy some time ago, I am desperate to find another so that I can read it over and over. A real classic of the genre."
2815,4,I hate reductionists,"As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish. But, as an incissive criticism of reductionist science, especially biology, it is very good."
2816,4,Yeay Wormie!,"Green Wormie is my new best friend.Take him with you into the shower after a long, stressful day and let him vibrate all of your worries away.Now if someone asks you if you have worms, you can proudly say, ""YES!"""
2817,4,Who knew worms could be so much fun?,"This is a delightful toy and very powerful. The downside is that it is very loud, looks like a child's toy, and it is a lint/hair magnet. However I would still recommend this product. It is a great product for misdirection or concealment if you at all concerned about getting flack for having a vibrator because the average Joe isn't gonna realize what it is unless you tell them. Great for travel since I personally think that it would be less embarrassing for some airport attendant to pull this out of your bag at checkout/check in then a different style vibrator."
2818,2,"Just so, so....",Just didn't care for this story. Synopsis was interesting but the story didn't keep my interest. I will not recommend this book and hesitate to buy another book from this author.
2819,5,Buy extra copies for your friends,"The book is short, engaging, and easy to read. It makes a strong case for keeping sexual sins out of your life and offers practical advice - as well as Biblical encouragement - for developing a lifestyle free of sexual misconduct. This book was well-received by my non-Christian friends, too, so don't hesitate to buy extra copies for them! Well worth the read."
2820,5,A Necessary Resource for the subject of Sexual Purity,"What a great book! It is short and to the point about sexual sin. A quick read. It discusses it in a very honest but tasteful manner. It provides plenty of scripture. It convicts the reader regardless of how much sexual sin is in their life (mental or physical) and gives practicle and biblical strategies to either avoid it all together or to combat the sin that the reader might already be ensnared in. This book is good for men AND women, high school age and above! Great resource for pastors and youth pastors to have on hand. This book has given me a realistic perspective and has helped me to understand that where it all starts is with that first thought or that first glance...and that this is where we recognize it as sin and stop the process. Life changing!"
2821,5,Works as advertised,"I just installed 2 garage door openers (Chamberlain) and I wanted a simple dual control module. This is not as fancy as the ones that came with the openers but it works just as well. I don't need any LCDs on my garage door openers. I just want a simple, easy to use opener that looks nice. This fit the bill."
2822,3,"Eat Well, Feel Great, Gain Weight","I love the receipes in the book. The only thing I have a problem with is that the book states that ""No more weighing"", however it does not explain what an actual serving size is, it mentions briefly that you can weigh your food to get an idea of what a serving is, and then use your judgement from then on. Well, being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem. That would mean, I WOULD have to weigh my food to figure out whether I am eating a serving or more. The title of the book is misleading, as well as the excerpts on the back and front cover."
2823,1,The non-chef's cookbook (subtitle: Not just for dieter's),"I have had this cookbook for a couple of years without really using it. But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters. I am also not the type to write book reviews (this is the first and probably the only) except that I think so highly of this cookbook that I wanted to recommend it to others."
2824,5,great disk,"I've liked Soul Coughing for a while now. I first heard them on the X-files soundtrack. Over time, I became more familiar with the band's music. When I heard that soul coughing released lust in phaze, I thought that was a great idea since I did not own any of their albums so I figured that Lust in Phaze would provide a good introduction to the band. After buying and listening to the album. Lust in Phaze covers soul coughing's career from Ruby Vroom to El oso. It also includes unreleased songs like Casiotone Nation peformed live. There is also the song from unmarked helicopters from Songs in the Key of X.Overall, the album provides a really great history of a band that should have been given more attention for its great music."
2825,4,A movie that makes Sopranos look like a network soap opera,"Ok never heard of this guy knew of Omar Epps seen him do mostly Black Dramas so along comes this movie that had it not had him on the cover I probably would have ignored it so I picked it up read the back cover put it down came back a week later on one of movie nights at home and pop it into my DVD player and was loving it from the moment it started Takeshi kitano is pure genius he made me chuckle at his mannerisms but I loved his intimate relationship with Omar Epps character after running into him on the street. I'm glad there was a mix of races in this movie from Asain ,Blacks,Hispanic and,Italian.It gave the movie depth it made it seem more realistic. The only reason I gave it four stars was that the pacing threw me for a couple moments and I was tempted to fall asleep until the action started other wise it was a treat to see definently a buy when I can track it down on DVD."
2826,5,A great movie - beyond just violence,"Beat Takeshi provides another violent movie, whose purpose seems to be that violence begets violence, and ultimately it's a dead end. The basic plot has Takeshi playing a yakuza forced to leave Japan upon the death of his boss. He finds his half brother in LA pushing drugs rather than attending school. Takeshi violently turns the small time crew into a major crime cartel.Yakuza themes of loyalty to family and honor over life pervade the movie. The omnipresent violence somehow avoids being gratuitous, perhaps because one realizes how more graphic it could have been. Unlike traditional western shoot 'em ups, we are left with the aftermath instead of the fight scenes themselves. At times it is hard to follow the plot and remember who is on whose sides, but perhaps that is the point."
2827,1,TRUE CHRISTIANS recognize this book as a COMIC! book hahaha,"The Paid clergy are ""witnessing"" to their flocks to beware of the scarry Mormons!! If the truth be know, the paid clergy and evangelical hypocrites are more intersted in maintianing there meal tickets and car payments. haven forbid that there is a TRUE CHURCH of the Lord that doesn't pay its clergy, and young 19 year old men and women go on missions at their own expense. Gosh, those sound like christ like traits w, wonder why... ALL, PLEASE IGNORE your paid clergy and Evangelical Witnesser's, they are wrong and blinded by money. Seek out and LET THE MORMONS IN. YOU WILL JOIN THE countless MILLIONS who have found TRUE HAPPINESS and TRUE knowledge of CHrist and become a TRUE CHRISTIAN, a MORMON."
2828,1,Glad I let them in!,I let the missionaries in and am forever thankful that I did. I wish I had grown up in the church--but I'm very happy that my kids are learning an important set of VALUES which they have the agency to choose to incorporate into their lives.
2829,1,choco tacos,"I have to say I haven't actually read this book, but I feel like if you are considering giving this author a chance to influence your eternal salvation, you ought to give the nice people who come knocking at your door a chance too. Then pray about what you have learned and decide for yourself. But if you want to celebrate over Choco Tacos, you would have to go to Taco Johns, I used to work there and they are the ones who sell the tasty treat. (see other reviews for this book to understand what I am talking about!)"
2830,2,Would you like to know more?,"Let me add a piece of advice to the ideas proposed in this book. When you hear the words, ""Would you like to know more?"" just say ""No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, ""I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!"" I replied, ""Probably better."" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs. She must have spread the word in the neighborhood, because I wasn't bothered after that. Though this book poses some good questions, my advice is to not even get started or you are in for an evening of flip charts!"
2831,1,Fascinating,"Actually, Taco Bell DOES sell ChocoTacos - I just had one myself! As a Mormon, I have to say that I found this book mildly amusing. The ""carefully hidden secrets"" about the founders of the church have never been hidden from me. There is nothing in Mormonism that is ""covered up"" - everyone is free, and encouraged, to learn as much as they possibly can! What the missionaries teach is the truth - the basic beliefs of the church. If you study them, the other controversial topics that come up have little relevancy to what we actually believe and what we practice. I have studied many religions and I've found that even among ""mainstream"" Christians there is a wide range of beliefs. It is the same for Mormons, and yet people are continually telling us what we do and don't believe! Really astounding when you think about it."
2832,1,Easier way to handle the Mormons at the door.,"I have an even easier way to handle the Mormons at the door, and I'll give it to you for FREE. When they come to your door, say ""Thank you, but I'm not interested"" and then close the door. Save yourself 6 bucks and let people believe what they want. I do this every time some person comes peddling to my door. Be it a salesman or a religious representative of any religion."
2833,2,Most Difficult English Assignment I ever had...,"I had the honor of reading this book in my 9th grade Advanced English class and while I am an avid reader and love all different types of literature this book still makes me cringe when I see it on summer reading list.While I've read review and I wish I read what they read because it seems like a very good book, but I could not make it through this book to save me. It was 10years ago I had to read this book and I often wonder if I picked it up today would it make any sense? But out of all the books I read throughout highschool and College this book is tedious and very difficult to read.Even with a tutor and note taking I still did not pass the exams that were related to this book."
2834,2,Boring!,William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!
2835,3,"Different, a book to be read by all!","When asked to read this book my first reaction was, it looks so old, it can't be good. As i started to read it i found it different from all other books that i had read. The book is slow at the start but it does become more interesting as the author discribes the way the world is seen by Neanderthal man; 'pictures' are memories and they believe logs are alive and have a mind of their own. William Golding's view point on their world is really an eye opener and this is a book that should be read by all. Inspiring!"
2836,4,SHOTGUN,"THIS CD IS MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH RUSSELL GUNN'S TRUMPET.ITS A NICE SURPRISE . I DO HEAR A NEW TEATMENT HERE FOR ""OLD CHESNUTS"" HE HAS HIS OWN VOICE IN THE INSTRUMENT AND A GREAT FUTURE AHEAD."
2837,5,You can't go wrong with the Simpsons,"I purchased this set specifically for the Edgar Allen Poe's, ""The Raven,"" spoof, but the entire set is a great addition to any Simpsons' Fan video library. I recommend highly!"
2838,1,Fuzzy Logic,Something NOT being disproven[sic] doesn't make it true. Example: You can't prove there isn't a tooth fairy.
2839,3,i regret loosing the hour glass shape,"I got the garment and oh my,I had a perfect figure using the garment.The rubber detatched on the lower right side of the abdomen in less that 3 months and each time i put it on,i looked like i was pregnant on one side of my abdomen.People are wondering what happened to my hour glass shape and honestly i am considering getting a replacement but my fear is the issue of durability.I enjoyed the hour glass shape the garment gave me while it lasted.Chibuzor N."
2840,1,Nothing Like Described,"Received the product and it is NOTHING like described. Instead of the item as shown, the item is only a short stomach wrap and not a more full body item as pictured. Returned."
2841,2,Ouch!,I thought I was going to break by hands trying to get this on. There are like a MILLION little bra like hooks all the way down this thing and it takes FOREVER to get them hooked and it hurts my hands like crazy! BUT my fiancé did say that once I had it on he could see the difference it was making but by the time I got it on I was too fed up with it I just wanted it off! Go get some spanx!!!
2842,1,MNOnlineBuyer2012,"Worst thing ever... I don't know how anyone could even wear this thing... It is so uncomfortable, and it hurts to sit down... and it makes you look lumpy. It's in my drawer collecting dust. I've owned it for almost a year, and gave it many chances, and I still can't get comfortable with it. I'm better off getting the cheap one at the local mall or some plain ole spanks!! Kudos to anyone who can wear this thing all evening under a beautiful cocktail dress or gown... not me!!! I wouldn't recommend it to family or friends... it is overly priced."
2843,2,Very difficult to put on,The product was very difficult to put on that I just gave up on it. Couldn't return it because the orginal wrapping had been thrown away.
2844,3,"I'm with Omaha - Mormon PR all the way, but enjoyable.","This book - like the Tabernacle Choir, a visit from Mormon Missionaries, and the video *Ensign to the Nations* - is both appealing and enticing. It gratifies you, while showing you how WONDERFUL the LDS church is.I enjoyed paging through this book(Did you know that Salt Lake City has a clothier which specializes in attiring LDS missionaries?), but I have to say - it makes my heart heavy."
2845,2,Wan't as described,There was an inscription on inside of cover that wasn't described. Other than that price was fair. xxx xxx xxx
2846,4,"i actually cried, i never cry when i read a book","i hated this book when i picked it up. my 8th grade class is making me read a war book and what better then a nazi/jewish story? wrong!! it was an amazing story....not one to want to read again, but one you get the first time. i guess my parents aren't really that bad, compared to hers"
2847,4,"Good, but the ending could have been better","This book was very good, but the ending could have been better before adding on a sequel to it. I recommend this book. This book can get you upset though. Patty, the main character, is constantly beat by her father."
2848,3,not exciting but good considering it was for school,This book is a one sitting book an ok book overall.Although naturally being a novel it has its turnoffs for instance throughout the book patty(main character) is in a search for heart and love and truth and right towards the climax when the book starts to jerk a few nerves and get your blood pumping faster it comes to a sour unresolutionary ending it basicly left me in the same state of mind as the whole book:important info not there in an unsuspenseful way. Also vital in a good book you have to like even spartially the main character which i didnt in this book. Patty was selfish and to hard to please and not mentally mature. I give it a B and for summer homework (which is why i read it)a B+
2849,4,A Story with a Tooth-and-Nail Heart,"This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart."
2850,2,way too sappy!,"this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book."
2851,3,Summer Of Josie's German Book Report,"This is a story of Patty Bergen, a trouble making, homely thirteen-year-old growing up on the American World War Two homefront. Patty's parents are verbally abusive, and her father is known to beat her on occasion. When a German POW escapes from the local prison camp, she allows him sanctuary in hidden rooms in her home. This German soldier proves to be her first love and one of the only people who truly loves her back.I, personally, would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. The novel had well-developed characters, and that was mostly what the author concentrated on. It seemed Bette Greene wanted to just develop a character, and not a story. When something tragic happens to Patty, I'm so busy learning everything about her that I did not shed a tear. Summer of My German Soldier seems to be an analysis of the adolescent human mind, not a novel I could fall in love with."
2852,3,MIND TEASER!!,": "" Summer of My German Soldier"" is about a girl named Patty, who is 13yrs old, and how she tries to hide a secret from everyone, except a black woman, who is her maid and nanny, Ruth. Ruth is her only friend until she meets Anton, a Nazi soldier. Anton (his nickname) is a prisoner of America after the WWII. The narrator tells where the Nazis stayed when the war was over. Plus Bette wrote how people treated the Nazis when they came over- but also Bette writes how some of the Nazis were nice! I thought that this is an awesome book!!!"
2853,3,What it is like to be an outcast,"""The Summer of my German Soldier"" gives an inside look to what it is like to be outcasted by society, family, friends, and peers. It is an ideal book to teach to high school students. Patty, the main character in the book, is abused by her parents physically as well as emotionaly. All she wants is love, and she finds it with a German prisoner, Anton, who was brought to US soil to be held.Germans were not liked by US citzens. It didn't matter if the Germans were soldiers or citizens themselves. The hatred was the same for both. Patty, outcasted by her family, took a liking to Anton. She looked at him for who he was; not what he was. This is an idea that should be instilled in all people.And this is the reason why this is a good book to teach to high school students. It can show them new ways to look at different people."
2854,3,Leo Young - The Magickal Childe,"Odd Italian techno, courtesy of Leo Young. Even though the sampldelic ""A True American Hero"" is all about the bongo and electric guitar funk, we soon find ourselves in the bouncy noir of ""Cagliostro Is Back."" The drums that announce ""4 The Emperor"" seem a far cry from the anti-erotic moaning on ""DJ Pimp And The Scarlet Woman."" Young, above all, seems to be having fun, and there's nothing wrong with that: The retro disco of ""Mega Therion""; the returning bongos on ""The Caliph And The Alien""; or the pagan groove of ""Magus Tannino."" Enjoyable, if not particularly deep."
2855,4,Cute story :),"I had no idea we had this book, I found it in my basement :)Tomas is usually watched by his sister after school until is mother gets home, but one day his mother is late and late, so his sister leaves him alone so she can get to her job. He's a big boy, right?This book realistically covers the normal feelings of being scared on your first time alone in the house, and also Tomas' pride in his resourcefulness in having an impromptu party for his teacher when she shows up at his door (to invite his mother to a school meeting, apparently).A previous reviewer said the characters are African-American. This is possible, however, with the names Tomas and Ana I suspect they may be Hispanic instead. No matter, it's not a crucial plot point."
2856,4,This is a great machine,"I was a bit hesitant to spend so much on a rice cooker. From my 20+ years of making white rice almost daily, a rice cooker is a rice cooker. After using this machine everyday for 2 months, I find it to be no different from the many others I had used of similar style (ie a non-removable outer lid and a removable inner lid), except that it has something I desperately in need of --- a timer. The quality of the cooked rice is the same, though it takes almost twice as long to cook and reheat as other cookers. As another reviewer mentioned, I too don't particularly care for the condensation dripping, but I did not find the gross build-up. I find this cooker to be more bulky than my previous 10-cup cooker. However, because of the timer, I am very happy with this machine."
2857,1,ABRIDGED!!!,"I bought this so I wouldn't have to spend a fortune on the book for school. Well this Kindle edition is so abridged, I found I didn't read half of the play. Don't waste your dollar. Find another version of this play."
2858,2,A little bit wimpy.,"They write good music. They play their instruments well. The can write crafty hooks. So blame it on the singer and the lyricist (my guess, same person). The vocals are as weak as it's content, which ranges from anywhere to wimpy subjects as being afraid to ride rollercoasters to things so dull and ordinary it makes you roll your eyes when you hear them. The closest comparisons to this band is Orange Peels. Never heard of them either? Then imagine what Air Supply would sound like if they made an alternative album. The Lucksmiths could be a great a band if they didn't sing about such stupid things. ..."
2859,5,A good game and a great Anime,"If you have played the games then you know the basic story of this anime.Compared to the Video Games of the same titles the story seems trimmed down and quit a few things changed.However as a anime this story is done rather well, the animation seems choppy in some places but it is done rather well as well.The story moves quickly due to it only being 12 30 min. episodes but you will enjoy it over and over again.This is a great Sci-fi anime with alot of action.If you like sci-fi action then this one is for you...."
2860,3,"Okay, but not great",This review is from my nephew: Not enough episodes or back story on the characters; but it had a good plot and pretty good artwork.
2861,5,It's a Guy Thing,"Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss."
2862,3,A little harsh for my older gums.,"I had been using GUM brand, but cannot find them just now. They were very soft and flexible for older gums.If you have a young, healthy mouth - these would be fine, I'm sure. They work fine, just a little harsh for older mouths."
2863,1,I'd rather stick razors into my mouth,"Maybe it was my bad to buy a knockoff product that was so cheap. Compared to Gum brand picks, Doctor's BrushPicks are unusable. The picks have no flexibility or give. Maybe I could use them to clean out tiny metal machine parts."
2864,5,Doctor's Brushpicks,Exactly as advertised and works much better than the Walmart brand which was tried after the original container of Doctor's Bruhpicks was depleted.
2865,4,Liked them...didn't love them,"These brushpicks worked and did what they said they would do and most of them were excellent, but more than a few had rough places on the pick and the brush which was the reason I gave them 4 stars. It would help if they were uniform in quality."
2866,5,Easy to use and it fits,"I could not find a bike rack from either Yakima or Thule that would attach to my two cars. So, it was with a great deal of trepidation that I ordered the Saris sight unseen. The mounting instructions were easy to understand and the rack attachs firmly to either of my two cars. Being the lazy sort, I store it in the mounting position for one of them. When I need to use it, I simply position the straps and snug them up. The straps are well made and protect the attachment points.Movement of the front wheel is minimal, but a bungee cord securing it might be advisable for long or bumpy trips.The practical and minimalist design of this rack is outstanding. I will tell anyone who seeks my advice on a bike rack to check out Saris before looking at any of the competition."
2867,2,"Nice rack, but",Make sure your bike will fit the rack. They have a chart to make sure rack fits car but not that your bike will fit rack. I have two Treck Pures. They won't work on this rack.
2868,2,overpriced and bulky,"I purchased this rack because it looked modern and cool. When it arrived, I was disappointed to discover how big it is. Even when folded, it takes up a lot more space than other racks. Since I have a small car, space is important to me and I don't want a rack that won't fit in my trunk or my closet.Also, the straps required a lot of effort to adjust and I could never get it really tight.There are better racks that are much cheaper, so I would recommed looking elsewhere. I exchanged this rack for an Allen Ultra Compact."
2869,2,President,"The book was in good condition, however, they should have stated that it had been owned by a library. I would have known then that it was stamped in several places and not have purchased it."
2870,1,Shockumentary: Extreme Collection,"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's."
2871,3,Pci Express System Architecture,(...)I spent a couple of days trying to use this book and found engineering inforamation and details lacking as much as they are lacking in the spec. I am looking at other references for engineering help.
2872,5,Perfect reference for PCIe newbie,I have 2 PCEe books and this one is the best one. I don't have any experience on PCI and PCI-X. This books really have a lot of basic stuff which is very good for PCIe beginners.
2873,4,Two from Agar,"Journey to the 7th Planet:A United Nation exploration team lands on Uranus and discovers that a ""brain"" rules the planet. This brain uses the memories from the team's mind to create images for them to experience while on Uranus (e.g. one finds a replica of his village, one that is scared of rats finds a giant one, and or course they all meet their girlfriends.)Invisible Invaders:The Invisible Invaders have been on the moon (of all places) for 20,000 years and have decided to take over the Earth unless it's surrenders immediately. Well the Earth does not surrender and the Invaders arrive and start taking over human corpses. These corpses march all over the countryside reeking havoc, and taking over bodies as people are killed. The day is saved when John Agar uses a high frequency sound device to drive the invaders out of the corpses."
2874,1,A book written by a torture lawyer,There's no way I would read a book and give profit to a man who wrote memos to attempt to allow Bush to circumvent the Geneva Convention against torture.
2875,5,Important to understand Constitution after 9/11,"This is an important book in order to understand the Constitution and the response to 9/11. The attacks on this book here are ridiculous. Even liberal critics of the Bush administration and Yoo think this is an important book. Cass Sunstein, a famous liberal law professor, wrote a review in the New Republic that said: ""The most important theorist of the 9/11 Constitution is John Yoo."" He says ""Yoo has offered an inventive and provocative set of arguments about fundamental questions, and he presents his arguments with unmistakable determination and all the skill of a good lawyer."""
2876,1,Yoo has no clue!,The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002. The constitution holds that declaring war is the responsibility of the Congress. If the Executive has grounds for war let him/her present them and Ccongress vote. Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results. This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue.
2877,4,Great except for...,"Yes, the version of Back of My Hand is not the original which is very disappointing. There is a different version on the vinyl album, and still another version on the Starry Eyes compilation UK Pop. There is also one 45 RPM B-side that did not make the cut for this CD and that is Dumb Blonde which is also an excellent 80's Power Pop song! Other than those issues the CD is GREAT, can better appreciate that 80's sound with the digital clarity and no Rice Krispies sounds from vinyl!"
2878,1,I didn't know they wrote so many songs,"I bought this album just for one song, their cover of ""There Goes My Baby"". The rest of the songs are okay."
2879,3,opening Night,Not the same standard as some of her other novels but worth the read. Seemed like the reason thrown in as an unrelated fact to everything else.
2880,2,1 good chapter,"The info in this book is terrible for a novice grower and an expert can use only the section on BREEDING thats it the only detailed chapter in the whole book.Another book lost in the past 70s and 80s knowledge of growing,and odd enough all the plant pics are of poor unhealthy,badly pruned,and terrible bud pics .....If you went by this book you will end up with the ABSOLUTE CRAP YOU WILL SEE IN IT!!!!!!!This guy makes me want to write a book on the subject very much,this book should be sent to 1970..............GEORGE CERVANTES REVISED INDOOR HORTICULURE IS YOUR BEST BUY TODAY and this book only for BREEDING..."
2881,3,Not for the experienced!,"This video is a little slow for intermediate to advanced exercisers. You don't really sweat that much, and it's kind of along the lines of ""Sweatin' to the Oldies."" If you like this sort of thing, then this is the workout for you. If you enjoy more fast pace aerobics that will get you sweating, try her ""30 days to thinner arms and abs."""
2882,4,Definitely a Motown party!,"I must admit that I couldn't stop smiling during this video. The choreography is somewhat challenging. But I enjoy learning routines. You watch exercise videos so many times, I prefer them to be a little difficult to master.If you don't like 60's Motown, don't bother. Otherwise, It's a lot of fun, and a great workout. You're so busy with the ""dance"" steps, the time goes by quickly."
2883,5,TO RAISE A JEWISH CHILD,"A MUST read for everyone who is dealing whith the infinite steps that should be climbe, during the raising of a jewish child, as she (he) should be raised."
2884,2,I like Elton but...,I admit I did not read the back of this CD carefully. I happily bought it and popped it into the CD player anticipating the wonderful tunes I had heard throughout the movie. But my favorites weren't there. The most important missing item? It's Tough To Be A God as sung by the stars of the movie. Elton John's duet with Randy Newman just isn't as much fun. It's not a bad album really. I was just disappointed.
2885,3,Where in God's name are they?,"Ok Elton has a wonderful voice I was thinking of hearing some song clips from the ""so called soundtrack"" I liked the CD up until It's Tough To Be A God I was shocked when instead of Kevin and Kenneth singing it was ELTON AND RANDY! I like all the songs expect It's Tough To Be A God you could of at least putted the people who really sang it on that song (He sounds a little selfish putting his own voice on there )Elton you are a talented singer and piano player ,but you could of just for once putted someone else on the sountrack beside's you and Randy.Here's my tip when you listen to the songs on the sountrack skip over track 8 because Kevin and Kennetth don't sing it just all Elton ."
2886,1,Never received,It is now June 5th and the cd has not arrived. Not happy. How do I get my money back? I had planned to perform a musical freestyle on my horse for a huge charity fair with this music but had to change my plans and use another selection as it takes weeks to compose the choreography and practice the timing with the horse..
2887,1,"the ""greatest?"" now wait a second..","Now, I don't want to downplay the importance of WW2 and all the heroes, known and unknown, that contributed to the efforts of that struggle.. But to dub them the absolute ""greatest"" is an insult to both older and younger generations. What about the Revolutionary War or the Civil War, or WWI for that matter? What about the founders of our country who fought so desperately on the American frontier long before any of us were born.. Being 19, i belong to a younger generation, one that doesn't (at present) have any large scale wars to fight, though I'd like to think we can still amount to something and not have to live forever in the shadows of our valiant elders."
2888,4,A good book that goes on too long.,"While the begining stories of the Medal of Honor winners were fascinating - and the stories of the famous were interesting - some of the others didn't grab me. It would have been better if it were somewhat shorter.I do agree with his premise - These people are from the ""Greatest Generation"""
2889,5,a fine tribute to the men and women of an aging generaion,"Brokaw certainly captured the spirit of the 30's and 40's and he went right to the horse's mouth to do it.He offers biographial sketches of the big and the small, the rich and the poor who shared a common life defining experience in WW11. A wonderful gift book for the sons and daughters and grandchildren of this wonderful generation who took it all in stride and returned to devote a lifetime to continuing to build a strong America."
2890,2,Tripe to make baby boomers feel good about themselves,"The book itself isn't bad - as bad as I would have expected from a media talking head.The problem is that the whole premise of the book seems to be a way for baby boomers to redeem themselves by attaching themselves to the people who fought World War II. This from a generation that never gave a thought for its own children, that trashed their parents until - surprise, surprise, they realized they're growing old, too. So now, all that is old is wonderful, when 30 years ago, all that is young was wonderful.So, while the baby boomers make themselves feel good, yet again, it'll be up to the generations after them to clean up their messes.More books like this will start pouring out as baby boomers realize their own mortality and start searching for ways to make themselves look better."
2891,3,"Great Concept, Poor Execution...","Intriguing notion of getting a feel for the events that shaped ""the greatest generation"", but the utter lack of depth in these vignettes really does a disservice, not only to the reader, but to the subjects of the vignettes themselves. These people obviously are so interesting, have had such intense experiences--why does Brokaw allow them each two or three pages? Disappointing to be sure."
2892,2,What about everyone else?,"Yeah, I'm impressed with everything that those veterans did in the years following the war, but Brokaw seems to focus only (or mostly) on those that became politicians or in government. What about the effects of the war on musicians? or artists? I would have liked to see him expand on his stories more. All in all, I felt obligated to finish the book (my mother raved about it, but then, she is one of ""those generation"") but I wouldn't recommend it or read it again."
2893,3,"An entertaining, quick read, but the thesis doesn't hold up.","It's true what some critics have said. This book is not the most skillfully or subtly written. It also whitewashes the issues by making the entire generation look like war heroes who later became business and government dynamos. This is not a balanced sociological study however, it's Brokaw's celebration of a generation and a set of values that he admires. Those values are almost exclusively the values of the warrior (warrior in battle and warrior in business). Once that limitation is understood however, the reader can settle back for a fun read. For younger readers who know little of this period in American history, this is a good starting place (but hopefully not an ending place). I congratulate Tom Brokaw for writing it. I only want to tell him that there are other ways to be great, and other generations have explored and will continue to explore those ways."
2894,5,A real treasure,"My husband loves watching documentaries, but cannot sit down and read a book. Until this one! He read everyday, until he finished it, and has started reading it again, 2 months later. His dad was an Army veteran, but he would never talk about it."
2895,2,A Story Already Told,"I had heard good things about this book, but was disappointed. This story had already been told in this format, and been told better, by Studs Terkel in his book The Good War. Terkel interviewed more persons, let them tell their own story, and interviewed persons who had been successful as well as those that had not. Brokaw focuses only on those that had gone on to become successful, while Terkel includes those from all walks of life. If you are interested in reading a history in this format, I would recommend The Good War over The Greatest Generation."
2896,1,"I agree with the title, but..........","I simply cannot understand why everyone is gushing praise on such a poorly written piece of patriotic blather. Is it that you can readily identify with the author when you plop down on the couch to watch the Nightly News? The rambling, disconnected content of this book left me wanting a refund. I am a proud American, and one who has studied this period of time quite extensively, and this definitely WAS the Greatest Generation indeed! This book, I fear, is going to lead to a host of copycat writings by those who will use their celebrity exposure to command a princely sum for a cliche-ridden hack job of a novel. Enough already!"
2897,1,Greatest? Who says so?,"Ugh, probably every generation thought it was the greatest. While this book is highly popular because it caters to the current generation, it is hardly objective or researched in comparing it to other generations. What is the measure of greatenss? If it is number of lives given for one's country, then surely the Civil War generation gave much more and at a greatest cost to family. If it is technology, then surely it is the current generation. Brokaw never mentions that this same generation produced the nazis and the repressive values that decimated American families once the war was over. I think the book needs to be toned down and put in its proper perspective."
2898,3,Somewhat tiring.,A great generation but an average book. Brokaw's celebrity status provided the publicity but you it's just plain boring after the first couple of chapters. The writing is flat and unimaginative.
2899,5,wonderful reading,Why do they abridge audio tapes of wonderful books? It's a crime and punishment to endure.
2900,2,Teleprompter journalism,"The storys of triumph and achievement are incredible and we owe a debt of honor to those who lived them and lived in the day. However the writing reminds me of a series of news segments on the nightly news. I found the book hard to read and bought the audio version and that too was unfinishable. I get a certain arrogance from Brokaw that I personally find hard to stomach. Just my opinion, I could be my revulsion of the product they put on the airwaves nightly and call the news."
2901,4,Easy Read,"Entertaining book overall but was a little ""hokie"" in some parts. The author chose an interesting format by compiling a collection of individual stories about World War II. All the stories share a common theme of sacrifice, courage and duty. A very fast and easy read. Students of World War II will especially enjoy this work. RECOMMENDED."
2902,2,Repetitive,"I couldn't even finish this book which says a lot because I hate not finishing what I've started. It's way to repetitive and one dimensional. The only part I really enjoyed of the book were the love stories. The rest were just the same thing over and over...guy joins the army, comes home and becomes a lawyer, politician, something of that sort. I have the utmost respect for that generation, but this book was lacking feeling..."
2903,2,utterly underwhelming,"This book has received a lot of attention and is selling well---but that's a testament to the power of the marketing machine that's been fired up behind it, not to the book itself. Search back articles from the Wall Street Journal if you want to read about how the marketing was done. You'll learn very little from reading the book itself, though."
2904,2,Disappointed!,"Americans reviewed EXTREMELY worthy--Just that there was no depth--more like a sound byte. And most of the stories came from American soldiers from the Midwest who were fighting in Europe. Hey,there were southerners, and there also was a PACIFIC War. Tom whom I adore and admire can do better than this!!"
2905,1,Is this man running for office?,"Rarely have I been so put-off by a book. I take nothing away from the experience and hardhships of the generation of Americans who suffered the depression and WWII. That surely is a 5-Star story and my parents lived it. But this book is not that story. Instead I find cliche's and stereotypes. For sure, the last 50 years of American history has been one of accomplishment and success. But it is easy to forget that this was largely because the rest of the industrial world was in rubble after the War, and America had a special opportunity to excel and grow. - - I feel alarm bells when any group of people are described as special or superior. This type of thinking has resulted in too much suffering in our world. I suspect the reality is that Brokaw is laying the groundwork for a political career. Is 'The Greatest Generation' the modern 'Profiles in Courage?.'"
2906,2,A fair picture of the depression/WWII generation,"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal. For those Marines who want a look at the same information, but just about the enlisted man of the Corps during that period, a comparable book is ""Gyrene"" written by Wilbur Jones, and published by White Mane Press."
2907,2,Good idea - poor execution - shallow and simplistic.,"I listened to Imus for two weeks, and had to have this book. The I-Man should stick to politics and sports; book reviews are not his strength. I really liked the concept, and couldn't wait to read the book, particularly after having seen recent video interviews of WW II veterans, and Saving Private Ryan. About 25% into it, I had to take a break. There is nothing exciting or revealing here - just the very basic facts, folks - and that doesn't make for five stars. It really is too bad, because the premise was good, that is, telling the stories of the greatest generation. But it's all surface; there's no depth, and, therefore, no interest in the people whose stories are being told. Sorry Tom."
2908,3,A pedestrain look at heroes who deserve much more,"Tom Brokaw has complosed short biographies of men and women who served in various ways in WWII, ways for which they should be honored. Their contributions in the war were given short shrift and no story is given the depth deserved. The book does serve a purpose, however, by reminding us that we are still living among heroes."
2909,3,Great tribute to a deserving generation,"As my father noted, (he's a WW II veteran of the Third Division who was in Africa, Italy and France), no mention was made in the book of the Third Division, which had more casualties, saw more combat and won more Congressional Medals of Honor than the Big Red. This is a glaring omission, which Mr. Brokaw should correct in the next edition. Please forward this critique to Mr. Brokaw. Many thanks."
2910,2,More Sound Than Substance,"I picked up this book intending to like it. ""Saving Private Ryen"" had predisposed me to a certain nostalga for the WWII generation, as had Dole's 1996 candidacy. Disappointment followed. The title, on reflection, is hyperbolic: was this really the greatest generation in all history, or even American history? Greater than the Civil War or Founding Fathers' generations? The stories are well-written, and interesting. The whole is not as great as the sum of the parts, however. I came away with the impression that this was another 'last good war' book, and thus it covering old ground. -Lloyd A. Conway"
2911,1,"I only read half the book, more than I wanted to.","I found the experiences of these people somewhat interesting but not enough to feel that it is a best seller. I was born in Britain and was there until my early twenties, and after reading the short stories of those people I felt as though my story could have been included but never ever thought that it was that interesting for it to be published. I lived through the ""Blitz"" and had acquaintances killed and bombed out of their homes. When I spoke of these experiences with my five children as they grew up, I could tell by their reactions that it was not one to dwell on. The book I found to be not that interesting. There are probably Tens of Thousands of stories like these, maybe more interesting than in the Greatest Generation."
2912,3,Misses a major irony...,"With numbing regularity, Brokaw and his news colleagues trash 1990s young people, apparently unaware that the youth of the 1930s, the ""greatest generation,"" were relentlessly trashed by the media, scholars, and politicians of their day as a cesspool of bad values, promiscuity, criminality, terminal apathy, drugs, welfare, and laziness. Maybe Brokaw should pause to reflect before regurgitating the latest ""kids today"" bashing his profession (and my academic one) specialize in."
2913,2,Sound bite literature,"This book has about as much depth as a 30 second news story on the six o'clock news with even less fact. Obviously written to sell, not to illuminate the people it pretends to reveal. Come on, is this all that can be said about ""The Greatest Generation""? Any PBS program dealing with WWII is infinitely superior and informative."
2914,2,Should have left the politics out.,"The day I bought this book I couldn't wait to start reading it. But I soon realized it was just another Politically correct book from one of TV's talking heads. Almost every life story in the book was about how they made it through the war and into the Democratic party to make the world a better place, with a few token stories about some other people who happened to be republicans and thus thier stories were glossed over. My question is, What does politics have to do with these storise? A disappointing book over all."
2915,3,Worth the read,"I hesitate to give this book only three stars, because it might not signify how much I appreciated reading it. I'm two generations removed from Brokaw's ""Greatest Generation"" and while I consider myself somewhat educated had never really appreciated the sacrifices made during WWII. So why didn't I give it a higher rating? Probably because I save those 4 and 5 star ratings for books one can truly call great -- ones which are that rare combination of style and content that result in a great work of art.There's little that is artistic about Brokaw's book, nor should there be. It is reported in a journalistic style, of course. But that being said, it is a book well worth reading and one that I recommend."
2916,2,"Shut up, Brokaw.","Evidently, the good news anchorman has been watching a little too much Saving Private Ryan lately. Naturally, the book gloats with little restraint over this generation's stance against fascism, neglecting its evident shortcomings as a nation half-governed by Jim Crow laws, or the social preception of the proper role of women as being confined to the household. Simply utilizing the fact that this generation took such actions that would easily have been undertaken by any sane people under these circumstances as an excuse to decry other generations as less worthy is grossly unfair. Yet, given Tom's journalistic background, his embellishments is hardly surprising. If anything, this book is testimony that history can only be properly evaluated by historians, not the news media."
2917,4,"Not The Greatest, But, A Very Good Generation.","Brokaw wouldn't sell many books with that title so he had to fog it in a bit. Yes, my parents generation gave willingly and sacrificed much. They had a definition of what the words duty, honor and commitment meant more than my generation does and, I fear, more than my children's generation.However, the lads who risked it all back in 1776 were our greatest generation. No other one even comes close. These were wealthy men who could have settled with The Crown and remained rich. But, they didn't. They risked it all for the sake of an idea. Then, made that idea work better and stronger than any society in the history of the world. Adams, Jefferson, Washington, etc. They were our Greatest Generation."
2918,1,A waste of time,"Mostly pontification. Where's the scholarship? The only reason I sat through this one was that it was an audio book and I was on an eight hour drive. If this is the greatest generation, I'm in the generation that got the bill. This book glossed over most everything. If anything it proved the opposite of its title."
2919,3,lousy writing,"juvenile, composition is terrible,reads like a high school term paperwhile stories of soldiers and their families can be interestingbrokaw turned this into a chore.it is jumpy, and a lazy selection of other peoples words"
2920,2,Publications crossed up,"I decided to buy The Greatest Generation 'Kindle Edition' and when I downloaded my purchase, I got instead 'The Greatest Generation SPEAKS'. The follow-up to it. Apparently this is some crossed up links at Amazon Kindle and if you look at this particular ad you will notice that in spite of the title saying 'The Greatest Generation', the actual graphic is from the aforementioned follow-up book. And I am warning you that if you click to buy, you may NOT get the book your actually wanting."
2921,3,Terrible shipping,"This product arrived with the box broken open which had been put back together with packing tape. The perforated display box was punched open and I received only 11 of the 12 packages that where originally in the box. The shipper should have put the display box inside a regular brown shipping box in order to avoid this problem. I'm giving 3 stars because the sunflower kennels were fresh and very good, however, because of this problem I am reluctant to order this product again fearing that I might receive fewer than 11 packages next time. I've decided to place my next order with another company through Amazon."
2922,4,TGMiller,"The Vtech I6775 5.8GHz 3-Handset System with Digital Answering Device and Caller ID is very easy to set up and use without the help of its user's manual.The display is easy to read and the ringer volume options are better than all of my previous cordless phones which were either too loud or too quiet, without much mid-range volume.This phone is a bargain in its price range."
2923,2,one of the batterys was bad,of the 4 phones 1 had a bad battery. It hasn't been worth the trouble of returning since there are still 3 good phones. might be what you get with amazon
2924,3,eh its aight,when i got it i wasnt impressed with the packaging.......another thing i didnt like was that it was kinda small.....like it said it would fit people 6'4 and up.....well im 6'1 and a half........and it was pretty small.....but other then that i do like it.....it is a nice vest....its good for airsofting
2925,1,"This is a FIRST EDITION REPRINT, not the latest 9th edition","If you want a copy of the original 1940s edition, that is what this is. The Amazon webpage makes it look like you are buying a paperback copy of the most recent hardcover, but that's not the case.I purchased this item and will be returning it, not because the the 2007 edited version is so great, but because this edition doesn't even have the benefit of the original authors correcting their own work based on feedback and review!!"
2926,1,this is not the latest version of the book!,"I bought the book because I think it is of the latest edition (edition 9?). But obviously, it is not, although it is printed in 2008.Amazon should specify the edition of the book!"
2927,3,"Good, Bad or Indifferent - still a must have","In my opinion, this is one of a handful of books that any good student or practitioner of technical analysis has in their library. It's not an easy read but making money in the market isn't easy either."
2928,1,NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND!,"Hello Champions, this IS NOT an OFFICIAL 2 Skinnee J's Digital Download! Support THE BAND by downloading it from the band's official website webstore (2SJ.com) where it's available for LESS MONEY and in Hi-Res format!-=AA/2SJ"
2929,5,Great Review for the DBA,"After reading this book and playing with the included practice test you will be in great shape to pass the 70-228 exam. That's assuming you already have a working knowledge of either SQL Server 7.0 or 2000. If you are not a DBA this review will not do the trick.One other note, while the practice test does not include many questions they will prepare you well for the exam. I found them as helpful as any of the more costly test prep products."
2930,1,They just keep milking the old stuff,With 100s of unreleased tapes in the archives all Universal can do is re-hash old stuff again and againThe CDs are classic Allmans but why a box set ???
2931,5,Great book,"I recently purchased this book and have found it to be immensily useful. My infant son died three months ago and I have been scouring literature to help me 'face' my grief. I love this book and, at times, I am shocked how elequently Kathy writes how I am feeling. I like the Biblical devotions that accompany each chapter. I use this book as a sort of Bible study to give me Biblical foundations to build my healing upon. I know that someday I will be a sort of 'mentor' to another parent who has lost their child and this is a book that I will give to them. I would say that this is a must-have. Also, if you are reviewing this particular book, I assume you also have experienced the loss of a child or know someone who has....my heart goes out to you."
2932,5,"Be aware: The insert is in Japanese, and there are only 12 tracks. But it's worth it anyway.","The insert in this CD is almost entirely in Japanese, which was somewhat of a disappointment to me. And Amazon lists 17 tracks for this CD, but the CD that I got (directly from Amazon, not through a dealer) had only 12 tracks. Tracks 13-17 shown on Amazon were not on the CD.Despite these two problems, this CD is still very much worth having. This is truly beautiful music."
2933,5,A correction to Amazon's list of performers,"In Amazon's description of the CD, they list the backup musicians as though they were primary, and make no mention of most of the actual choir members. Connor Burrowes sings the solos, backed up by his younger brother Edward, Simon Acott, Tim Burtt, Gerald Beatty, Matthew Davies, and Edward Pattenden. Critics have acclaimed Connor Burrowes as possibly the best treble soloist in recording history. As of 2007, he is still at university studying music, and has developed an excellent tenor voice."
2934,3,"It's OK, but too environmentally wacko!","The work is is good and long. But, the commentary about environmentalism distracts from the work out. I'm not one of those kool-aid drinking environmental wackos."
2935,2,a lot of useless information (within the total of 754 pages),"This is the kind of book which asks to be read for hours and hours AND then you go on double check on the internet. E.g. the list of hotels in Santa Cruz refers to the type of traveler who loves to spend more than $250 per night - tripadvisor.com offers a different picture...While planning a tour I'm looking for a tour guide which gives me distances on the map, smaller maps with an overview about an area or town (not only for SF or Yosemite) and more background information than the frequent use of adjectives (""breathtaking"" ""the world's most spectacular"").There is a lot in this book BUT..."
2936,5,An excellent coffee table book,I purchased this book while in the Smoky Mountains. Even paying full retail it was a bargain with all of the great photographs and short but well written narrative to accompany the photos. An excellent photo book!
2937,3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"BY THE REVIEWS YOU WOULD THINK IT WILL BE GLORIOUS,BUT I HONESTLY LIKE ONLY 3 SONGS....BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME."
2938,2,"Good, but already heard.","I expected this album to have NEW remixes but I felt like I was listening to the Love:Destiny CD (a special remix CD DC, put out for target.)We've all heard, Say my name mix, Jumpin jumpin', bug a boo and some others,the only ones i lke are Nasty Girl, ID2,and Dot, which are new remixesI liked Michelle's song. She a an ok voice, I was happy not to hear Beyonce wailing on the track. I still think this could have had ALL new remixes and I would have given more stars."
2939,3,Excellent but needs more....,"THIS IS THE REMIX is a great remix cd overall.. i just think that they were being a little bit lazy... if they had the strength to release a remix album then bring new material not old turned new...dont get me wrong.. this is one of my favourites by DC3...my favourite song on here is ""dot"" the original was not that appealing at all until i heard the remix... this song is a constant in my cd changer in the car...other car bangers ""emotions"" (neptunes), ""bug-a-boo"" (refugee remix) ""no, no, no"" (extended) w/ wyclef and ""jumpin jumpin"" (so so def).I am not feelin the 'survivor' (extended) because 1. not extended at all, 2. da brat is not rapping as good in it, and 3. michelle's part is cut out of it (her part in 'survivor' is the best in the whole song). also, the 'so good' is not all that great. 'independent woman pt. 2' is the worst song DC has ever put out.overall this cd is alright but most of the remixes are great, and most of all of them suck...3.5= very average"
2940,4,It's Destiny's Child so it must be good!,"Ok, so it's only a remix album- the band are currently at a 'crossroads' in their career so this package has been quickly released.On the whole, the remixes are of a superb quality (the best ones being the incredible ""Bootylicious Rockwilder Mix"" and ""Say My Name Timbaland Mix"").The problem is: Independent Women Mix and No No No Pt 2 have already been included on DC's previous albums.Also, the ""Survivor"" and ""Jumpin Jumpin"" mixes are good, but there are better ones.A remix of ""Get On The Bus"" would of been nice,too."
2941,5,Exellent and great value. (5 star but could not enter above),The large muff is a great product for someone with circulation problems. Holds the heat for hours.
2942,5,Excellent for kids,My son loves it. And he keeps watching it. Lots of lessons to learn from this movie. Even adults can benefit from watching a child movie.
2943,1,Ummmmmm........scared,"I think that this is innappropriate for kids, because they should not grow up thinking that vegetables can talk. This should be taken into consideration before purchasing this video. My daughter now talks to any vegetable that comes home with the groceries."
2944,3,Obscure Mod Revival Group,"I came across this group totally by accident in the early eighties, finding a cut-out bin vinyl copy for probably under a buck;they looked cool and I took a chance, and it proved to be more than a worthwhile purchase. Because of this group's obscurity I was surprised to see it released on CD, although the Japanese put out plenty of stuff like this. This record is pleasant, listenable, but nothing earth shattering. It should appeal to fans of The Jam, though the group is not quite in their league as songwriters. ""Time For Action"" and ""New Dance"" are the most memorable tracks. Some nice brass arrangements on this record also."
2945,2,Not much of a game,"While entertaining, there's not much ""game"" to this... game. It's all luck, no strategy or ability to impact how the game moves or progresses. While that may be age-appropriate for 2 year olds, this game is definitely well below the suggested developmental age range of 4. I wouldn't even rate the educational value of this game very high, as by the age of 4, kids can already count, discern directions, and read symbols. The game isn't worthless, just not on par with Gamewright's usual flair, and definitely developmentally geared toward younger children. As this game has small pieces, though, it wouldn't be feasible to play this game with children in that age range. I don't recommend this game for 4+. Rather, check out Kids of Carcasonne, or Monza."
2946,3,Not too good,"There are a few good songs here. Long Legged Linda notably, as well as I love Rock 'n' rollOh well"
2947,1,Simply Unbelievable: It died 14 months after purchase,I would of given it 0 stars because it died 14 months after I purchase it(right out of warranty). I would have thought that for such an expensive product that would be more durable or have a longer warranty such as Cuisinarts 3 year warranty. I know that the main reason that people buyer this rice cooker is to make rice in it. But for $150 it really should have a slow cook and steaming function. You can buy a fuzzy logic rice cooker from Panasonic with both of these features for less and Panasonic rice cookers last a long time.
2948,5,Fantastic Appliance,"** Be forewarned the 5 cups refer to 5 Japanese cups, each of which is equal to 3/4 cups. This does not hold 5.5 American cups**I did not even eat rice regularly before I bought my rice cooker. I do now!Reasons I love it:1. The rice comes out perfect every time2. Even brown rice is fantastic3. It cooks oatmeal on the porridge cycle and it is really good4. It is quick and easy to use.5. You can cook rice earlier in the day.6. I make extra rice with it and keep rice salad on hand for lunches.7. So, it has simplified dinner time and lunch time.I could go on and on. Do not hesitate to buy this.One small drawback-- the instruction manual is next to worthless. It makes sense to buy a cookbook like The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook by Beth Hensperger to go with it."
2949,5,Love it!,I have owned several rice cookers in the past but this one is by far the best. It makes perfect rice every time.
2950,2,Worked good for a month then became like any other rice cooker,"First off, we are an asian family and we cook rice everyday through the cooker or through a pot.This rice cooker was great for a month. The rice came out perfect and very soft and moist during that time. Now the cooker cooks the rice dry and hard like any other cheap rice cooker. Though we cleaned the lids and maintained it well, it's like one of those cheap cookers now; you just have to guess whether to add more or less water to get good rice.For the price, I expected more especially when you can get basically 5 or 6 decent cookers at Costco. In the end this machine will be like any other machine."
2951,4,For 3 cups making,"After reading all the reviews, I have settled on this model because:1) Made in Japan2) NOT made in ChinaWe have always made 2 cups of rice but always thought it didn't turn out the best but it was a lot better than the Tiger that I have had for 12 years. With 2 cups, the rice came out kinda soggy and too mushy even on the harder option. Then one day I had to make a little more rice and used 3 cups and the rice came out perfect!!! It wasn't mushy. The individual grains wad defined and soft and delish.The porridge setting made the congee silky like, almost a silken tofu consistency."
2952,2,"Good Rice, Poor Construction & Warranty","I agree with all the positive reviews regarding the quality of the rice, but I have to give this rice cooker 2 stars on the basis of its poor quality of construction. We've had this cooker for 5 months. The removable inner lid was recently dropped from a height of < 4feet. This short drop resulted in one of the tabs breaking off the inner lid. Since it was so new, I figured it would be under warranty, but Zojirushi said this wasn't covered and I had to pay for a new part ($15 with slow shipping, 10 days). I expected either better construction or better warranty coverage from a $155 rice cooker. (Now, effectively a $170 rice cooker for me) :("
2953,5,Working perfectly,"We have had no problems with this rice cooker so far (a month along), and are using it regularly (every 1-3 days). The rice tastes wonderful, and is consistent texture and stickniness every time. I appreciate the measuring cup and setting for no-wash rice, which is what we typically purchase. It also does a good job of keeping the rice warm, and it is very easy to remove and wash the inner lid along with the rice cooking pot, which is a big improvement on our previous rice cooker. We have cooked takikomi gohan in this rice cooker and it also came out great. The only minor quibble I have with this rice cooker so far is that the buttons are quite hard to press without also moving the whole rice cooker, and the button labels were slightly confusing so I had to read the (quite well written) instructions before using it."
2954,3,Battery Replacement,"For starter I have no complaints about the quality of the rice this machine makes but I am sure there are many other machines that make very good rice in the same price category. I am giving it a mediocre review because of the process and expense you have to go through to change the battery (even though it is only every 4 years or so). You cannot do it. The machine must be taken (or sent at additonal expense) to an authorized dealer who will have to desolder the battery from the circuit board for replacement. The charge for this work is around $20 or more plus $7+ for the battery. This process annoys me because I am sure other rice machines have a simple and inexpensive way to replace the battery (and it must be changed at some point, it won't work without it). Just something to be aware of."
2955,4,Good for busy mom,"I just started to use it about for a couple of weeks and find it very convenient, especially for me a very busy, full time working mom with kid. Setting up time and go, when back, you have the warm rice ready. I haven't use this kind of product before, so I can't compare this one with others. What I am worried about is the damage of the inner bowl and the built-in battery. Where to find the services is a question for the future. One thing I want to mention here is the user instruction, it is not easy to follow. Two weeks ago I remembered I set time and left for work, when I am back with take-out dishes, the rice was not cooked, we almost missed the concert."
2956,3,Too slow,"this rice cooker is really slow and unlike other reviews, this cooker does not make the rice taste better than the cheaper rice cooker we had. Our house is a blend of chinese and american and have a lot of experience with cooking rice."
2957,3,"Great Quality, Rice Tastes Great.","This product is excellent. If you want great tasting rice, use the regular setting (around 45-60 minutes to cook). If you're in a hurry, use the ""Quick"" setting for a 15-20 minute cook time. Apparently the ""Quick"" setting doesn't soak the rice but it seems to taste just as good. Overall, the device is compact, high quality, and has a convenient retractable cord. Although a little pricy, I feel that the quality and features are worth it."
2958,5,"Once into it, a wonderful and uplifting read.","Betsy Howie's Snow took me a few pages to get into -- she starts without providing the context upon which we readers tend to depend. I also feared that the book would be an angst-filled and self-absorbed ramble...it starts out feeling that way. After 20 pages, I was hooked. With creativity, humor, and heart, Howie takes us through a woman's self-discovery and her meeting of herself. There were moments when I felt I had lost the storyline, but that was due to my concrete thinking rather than any fault of the author. She asks the reader to stretch reality, break out of the dictates of linear time and one-dimensional experience, and imagine an inner world as real and tangible as the one we usually think of as ""reality."" I loved the cat, Vinny, who gently encourages the narrator on her journey of self-discovery. I loved that Vinny, himself, ended up learning about self-acceptance, truth, and happiness. I recommend this book highly!"
2959,4,Very Sturdy,"Ball is very sturdy and provides a great workout. Would have given it a five if the pump provided had not been so worthless. Threw it away after my first workout, which consisted entirely of trying to use the pump to blow up the ball. It wore me out and never got the ball inflated. Fortunately, I had a bicycle pump that worked well. But, the ball is great and you will be very satisfied with the ball."
2960,5,Use as a chair,I'm glad I bought the largest one since I am using this as a chair and to stretch on. High quality and holds up nicely.
2961,4,great,"i got this not for yoga but for sitting at my desk. there's nothing wrong with it, but it's just a bit too small for purposes of sitting at my desk. i'm 5'10"" and followed the measurements to get this 65cm ball, but too small. so i gave it to my sister. anyway, quality is great."
2962,4,"love the ball, be prepared to buy a pump","The ball is great (I ordered it to replace my office chair). I ordered the 75cm, and it is indeed 75 cm (at full inflation, which I am finding difficult to achieve, since the damn pump has already broken). 4 stars because the pump was seemingly made by grumpy people that lack hands or glue. The part of the pump that enters the ball usually stays in the ball (and breaks away from the main body of the pump). So you have to yank that part out (breaking your fingernails while listening to the whoosh as all of your hard-won pumped air whooshes out of the ball). So I haven't actually gotten the ball to full inflation; I am awaiting delivery of a different (and hopefully better-made) pump. I will update when I have had the ball for longer."
2963,1,NOT 75 CM,"just bought the 75cm Go Fit Proball. It was delivered quickly; however, when inflated, it is clearly not 75cm in diameter - though it's printed on the ball. In actuality, it's 55 cm. This is annoying."
2964,1,Not too useful without a functional pump!,The ball itself seems like it would be nice and sturdy -- unfortunately you need to actually put air into it. The accompanying pump is completely non-functional. The only exercise we are going to have with the GoFit Stability ball is the effort it takes to return it.Update a week later: OK...finally found a different pump and managed to inflate the ball. I have to say the quality of the GoFit Ball is excellent. But I leaving them with one star -- as the pump you are paying for should actually work!
2965,4,not as brilliant as some make it out to be,"OK first thing's first, I love the beta band. Secondly, they're a typical prog band. If you can imagine Stone Roses inviting Kraftwerk for an acoustic jam session (NOT an album recording though) you may get some idea of what this album is about.Standout tracks for ANYONE are Dry The Rain (of course), Inner Meet Me, She's the One, and Needles in my Eyes. Some of the other songs on the album are just too average and boring but good as background music when you're busy doing something.In some ways, the third album is more complete and much more accessible."
2966,5,Beatles + Beck + RadioHead = BetaBand,Beatles + Beck + RadioHead = BetaBandI love this album. Can hardly get past the first half of the CD becuase it' s so good I keep listening over and over. Cannot wait to hear what's in store on the second half!
2967,5,Al Rose's Storyville is a thorough and insightful account.,"In my research for a recent paper on the lives of prostitutes, I found this book indispensible, not only for its inclusion of interviews with actual Storyville prostitutes, or its thorough examination of the history and availiable statistics on the district, but also for the strange and beautiful photographs that are abundant in its pages. The expressions, attitudes, and settings the women and photographer chose say volumes about life in Storyville, as does Al Rose's wonderful book!"
2968,4,Good value for lesser price,"This devise delivers good volumn, is very light weight and remains firmly my ear during my daily activities; A good value."
2969,3,Best headset there is while it lasts...,"I absolutely ADORE this headset. It fits snugly in your ear without being uncomfortable, stays in place, sounds great, battery life is fine for normal use all day long. It took the tiniest bit of work to figure out the thingy that curls up inside your ear. Although it looks like it would be extremely uncomfortable, you can't even feel it in there. There's nothing to wrap around the outside of your ear, so it doesn't bind and it doesn't interfere with glasses or sunglasses. It's so light it just floats there.So why 3 stars? My first one, the Bluespoon AX, lasted about a month then overheated while charging and wouldn't stay on anymore. But, I loved it SOOOOOO much, I went out and bought a second one, this time the AX2. It lasted about 2 weeks and did exactly the same thing.Why, oh why, did they finally make a headset that truly fits in my life, and make it so poorly that it won't keep working??????"
2970,1,Echo,"Had to return this one. It echos back to the the called party. My hearing isn't the best and I needed to run the volume all the way up. If I held it pushed in hard the echo goes away. The manual says to turn the volume down to eliminate echo. Great, but, then I can't hear. Ordering a model with the mike further away from the speaker."
2971,1,stay away if u sre using T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA,Poor sound quality when paired with T-Mobile MDA / T-Mobile SDA.
2972,5,Great educational take on a classic song.,"My daughter and I love reading, singing, and signing this song/book! Great way to teach kids more than one way to read and Sing."
2973,5,#1 FAN SINCE THE BEGINNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"IF THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE THAT DOESNT HAVE NELLY'S NEW ALBUM, IT'S A MUST THAT U GET IT. IF U LIKED HIS OTHER TWO ALBUMS-SWEAT AND SUIT-THEN I KNOW FOR SURE YOU'LL LOVE SWEATSUIT. THE NUMBER 1 TRACK FOR ME ON THE ALBUM IS GRILLZ. WHEN THAT SONG COMES ON, I GOTTA TURN IT UP CAUSE ITS SO CRUNK AND CAUSE I LIKE GRILLZ ALSO.HOLLA!!!!"
2974,5,GRAEAT,I reallly like this cd!!!!!!! It so good I LOVE NELLY WITH A LL MY HEART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2975,2,only works with straight top tubes,"great looking rack. folds up small enough to keep in the trunk.HOWEVER, it only works well for straight top tubes and pretty much eliminates anything except road bikes. top tube adapters do not work well with this rack.Does not work well with over-sized tubed bikes. Large tubes simply do not fit into the slots."
2976,1,The Sari Bones is Good but it Takes the Paint off your car,"If you own a car that you don't care about the paint, then this bike mount is perfect for you. However, if you have a car that you would like to preserve your paint job, then invest in a trailer hitch mount. I personally like my mount but I'm giving it a 1 because it is really tough on the car's paint job. Especially where the 6 rubber tipped connectors attach to different parts of the body of the car. There is a lot of strain on the paint due to the weight of the bikes. The rubber feet on the top and bottom of the center of the device is great but it too will eventually harm your paint. Giving it a 1 because of this."
2977,5,Longhouse is Long Awaited,"The beautiful Guardian cover art is what got me to listen...but boy was I in for a treat - this group is incredible!! Extremely high quality sound, and I'm picky. There are few groups that come along like this one. Their sound is deep, rich, and meaningful. Their compositions are extremely unique in their non-standard song formats but each note intrigues and holds your interest, leaving you wanting to hear more, more, more! They draw your spirit into traveling and feeling alive, and nothing about this group is cheap-sounding. I've never heard this kind of music before (and I own almost every Native cd out there) - it has it's very own sound and I strongly commend them. All genres will be interested - from spiritual to upbeat, from contemporary to traditional, they've go it all in a new kind of blend. Wow - I was SO impressed! Telling all my friends and you! I bought everything they have. And it's timeless."
2978,2,I Fell alot on Beginner Trails,"After watching this video, I fell on Beginners trails. I also almost died getting on and off the lift. I should sue the producer."
2979,5,Great Christmas nostalgia for the 50+ generation: lovely!,"Amahl and the Night Visitors was a part of all of my early childhood Christmases, shown on the little family black-and-white TV in our 1950's, 1960's living room, and some years just aired on NPR on the radio (turned up loud on my dad's ""hi-fi"" so that we could listen to it in our beds.) For me and for many of my generation, this is the ultimate Christmas nostalgia item. I can still sing along to every word, and my grandchildren watched it over and over with me in fascination, pulled into the romantic story of the little crippled boy visited by the 3 kings on their way to the Christ child. Excellent sound quality and heart-wrenchingly beautiful voices."
2980,3,DVD Quality - Amazon Verified Purchase,"I am aware that the opera itself was first produced back in the 50s, but I would have thought the quality of the DVD would have been much better."
2981,4,Great Old Movie,I ordered this movie because I remembered watching it as a child. I told my children about it and wanted them to see it at least once.
2982,1,Menotti - Amahl and the Night Visitors,"The Quality is tenth rate, this DVD is almost unwatchable and the audio sucks."
2983,1,Not worth your time!,"Okay, so I read the bio on the series and thought I would like this anime. Boy, was I wrong. there are several cute episodes, but the story line is totally empty. Almost every episode is really sad, and in the end, the main character never reaches her goal. Everybody dies, and it is just aweful."
2984,5,A Great Short Series,"I bought this series based on reviews and the description, and I'm not disappointed. The DVDs arrived on time in perfect condition. It's a short series that consists of two discs with short episodes (and a third disc with ova episodes and extras). I thought it was funny at the beginning, how everyone has all these problems and Yukito is in the middle of it all, without really caring, and how Misuzu randomly falls. (this is funny until later, but I won't give it away), but it all follows a strong storyline, basically about a winged girl in the sky who has bad dreams, and most of the characters goals, overall, are to find her and give her good dreams. It sounds a little stupid when you say it, but it makes sense in the manga. Anyway, I liked this series, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new anime to watch. However, it's very short, so if it's a long, dramatic series you're looking for, I would not suggest this."
2985,1,Unplayable,Disc would not play here in Australia...due to wrong regional code. I suggest future offers of DVD's include warnings that some might not play in certain countries. I have had to return this item. W.Patey Queensland Australia
2986,4,enjoyable quick read,"Haven't read many books by L'Amour, but what I have read, I've enjoyed. This was fast-paced, with all the usual elements - gunfights, Indians, intrigue, romance, survival - all tied together in a good story.Nice twist at the end.Not really sure where the name Heller comes from though??"
2987,5,RAYMOND EDWARDS,I LIKE THIS BOOK SO WELL I WENT BACK IN TWO OR THREE PLACES TO MAKE SURE I REMEMBERED EVERYTHING ABOUT DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES OF STORY.
2988,5,The definitve work on Irish traditional culture.,"This is the work that those of us who have been studying Irish traitional culture have been waiting for years for. As far as I know, there has never been a work like this published. This is an amazing encyclopedia of articles that are very thorough and are written by people with impressive professional expertise. If you've ever come across a term or topic in Irish music or dance that you wished for more information about, this is the place to find it. The extensive appendix is a very valuable collection of sources from every facet of the genre. This reference work is essential for any serious student of Irish culture. It is well worth the price."
2989,5,I never put this romantic book away,This book stays on my coffee table because I use it all the time. It has changed my life because I've used it to cozy up every room in our home. It's made me fall in love with my home. I love the ideas that are shown in the pictures but really like the simple tips that the writer has emphasized which let me add romantic cottage touches to what I already own. I looked at other cottage books but they seemed too much about architecture or about rooms from Europe that don't look like my suburban home. This book has shown me that I can have a cottage wherever I live.
2990,4,Helped define exact style I want,"This is the first interior Design book that I actually purchased & I thought it was well worth the price. It gave a broad overview of various ""cottage style"" interiors - everything from rustic cabin to English garden cottage to plain American farm house. I was able to get a much more focused idea of the look that I want to achieve. I'm taking this book with me while shopping for a few new furniture pieces in the next 12-18 months and I think it may have prevented a costly mistake."
2991,2,Interdesign Clear Drainboard,"As nice as it looks, it was a disappointment. It doesn't slope to make the water drain into the sink, the edge is so sharp it cut my finger and last but not least, that ""tire rubber"" smell has not left after multiple washings. I've since been on the lookout for a better one."
2992,1,Do not buy.,I hate this memory card I had been using for 3 months for Madden 2000 when it became corrupted.Do not get stick to the basic Nintendo pack.Don't mess around I have had a nintendo controller pack since I owned my nintendo 64 (about a year and half now) and have never had a problem.I tried to save a few bucks and got burned.
2993,5,I truly believe it works when used properly,"When taken at the first sign of illness this product has helped me fend off a few colds and who knows what else.The key is to have it on hand and use it ASAP,drink plenty of water, eat well, you know the rest.It gives your immune system an added boost."
2994,3,"It took a Long Time to get ""Inside the Ropes""","One of the more disappointing books by John Feinstein. He acts like the people putting on the 2002 U.S. Open were working on a cure for cancer. But seriously if the people described have all the abilities that Feinstein accredits them with, why aren't they doing something more meaningful than putting on a Golf Tournament. ALSO since I am a Huge Tiger Woods fan the usual Feinstein bashing of Tiger is not appreciated. One thing that surprised me is that NBC dictates pairings and starting times. If David Fay has all the integrity that Feinstein gives him credit for, he should not allow NBC to be so selective.Also, I remeber watching this event on the tube. And Feinstein does not capture the enthusiasm that New Yorkers displayed for Phil Mickelson. The Book does not mention that he was called ""The Mick.""The only question was how low to rate this book. Though unscientific 3 stars ""feels"" right."
2995,2,A MAJOR ( PUN INTENDED) DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was so disappointed in this book. Having read most of Feinsteins other works. It was certainly not, "" Inside the Ropes"", as the sub title implies.I was totally bored by the business end of the open. Aside from the introduction, the golfers don t enter the book for about three hundred pages.I found myself skimming to get to the good stuff, which took a long time to materialize."
2996,4,Good Inside look at the U.S. Open,"The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best."
2997,1,A Good Open Spoiled,"The subtitle should be, ""Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,"" because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, ""A Good Open Spoiled."" Don't waste your money."
2998,2,"Good ideas, but horrible context","I praise Ostebee and Zorn for making an attempt to make calculus easy and for everyone. But I just don't think that is true. Calculus is a sophisticated form of mathematics and sometimes it needs to be taught with vocabulary and methods within the mathematics community and outside of everyday life. When you combine this with the usual high number of mistakes present in a first-edition book, a great deal of the phrase ""we'll discuss/define this soon"", excessive use of the graphing calculator, and some pretty lame jokes, you get a product that's not really worthy of being used in a college-level course."
2999,3,High Volume of Typos,"This is not a literary review of Philip Roth's work, but of the quality of this digital translation. I'm only into about the first 50 pages or so, but got so annoyed with the high frequency of typos in this digital version that I felt compelled to bring it to Amazon's attention. I just bought my Kindle a few days ago and this is actually my first digital book I'm reading, so I have nothing to compare it to in terms of frequency, other than paper books, however, for the price that Amazon is charging to download these books, the quality of proofreading should be just as good or better! This is unexceptionable."
